<h2>Statistics for The First Change</h2>
<p> <b>COV</b> is the coefficient of variance, a unitless measure of how broad the curve is, stdev/mean. A high <b>COV</b> means that the stat varies a lot between different playthroughs.</p>
<p> <b>COV2</b> is COV using max instead of mean, better for non-normal right-tailed distributions. In other words, if a stat starts out at 0 instead of 50, <b>COV2</b> will be a better measure than COV of how much it varies.</p>
<p><b>PMODE</b> is what proportion are the mode, to identify untouched stats. A <b>PMODE</b> of 100% means that the stat is always the same in every playthrough; <b>PMODE</b> is the percentage of time that the game never touches that stat.
