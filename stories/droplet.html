<p align="center"  style="text-align:center;line-height:200%"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >1.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Today Shar is Marilyn Monroe. That's an erotic god from prehistoric cartoon

mythology. He has golden curls, blue eyes, big breasts, and skin of a shocking pale pink. He stands with a wind blowing up from Hades beneath him,

trying to control his skirt with his hands, forever showing and hiding his white silk underwear.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Today I am Shivol'riargh, a more recent archetype of exaggerated sexuality. My skin is

hard, hairless, glistening black. Faint fractal patterns of darker black writhe across my surfaces. I have long claws. It suits my mood.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We have just awakened from a little nap of a thousand years, 
our time, during which the rest of the world aged even more.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He goes: &quot;kama://01-nbX5-#...&quot;</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I snap the channel shut. &quot;Talk language if you want to have sex with

me.&quot; </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar pouts. With those little red lips and those innocent, yet knowing eyes, it's

almost irresistible. I resist.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Come <u>on</u>, Narra,&quot; he says. &quot;Do we have to fight about this every

time we wake up?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I just don't know why we have to keep flying around like this.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;You're not scared of Warboys again?&quot; he asks.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His fingertips slide down my black plastic front. The fractals dance around them.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;There aren't any more,&quot; he says.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;You don't know that, Shar.&quot; </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;They've all killed each other. Or turned themselves off. Warboys don't last if there's

nothing to fight.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Despite the cushiony-pink Marilyn Monroe skin, Shar is harder than I am. My heart races

when I look at him, just as it did a hundred thousand years ago. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His expression is cool. He wants me. But it's a game to him. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He's searching the surface of me with his hands.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;What

are you looking for?&quot; I mean both, in the Galaxy and on my skin, though I

know the answers.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Anything,&quot;

he says, answering the broader question. &quot;Anyone who's left. People to

learn from. To play with.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >People to serve, I think nastily.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I'm lonely, too, of course, but I'm sick of looking. Let them come find us in the

Core.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;It's so stupid,&quot; I groan. His hands are affecting me. &quot;We probably won't

be able to talk to them anyway.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His hands find what they've been searching for: the hidden opening to

Shivol'riargh's sexual pocket. It's full of the right kind of nerve endings. Shivol'riargh is hard on the outside, but oh so soft on the inside. Sometimes I wish I had someone to wear that <u>wasn't</u> sexy.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;We'll figure it out,&quot; he says in a voice that's all breath.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His fingers push at the opening of my sexual pocket. I hold it closed. He leans

against me and wraps his other arm around me for leverage. He pushes. I resist.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His lips are so red. I want them on my face.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He's cheating. He's a lot stronger than Marilyn Monroe.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Shar, I don't want to screw,&quot; I say. &quot;I'm still angry.&quot;</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >But I'm lying.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Hush,&quot; he says.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His fist slides into me and I gasp. My claws go around his shoulders and I pull him

to me.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >2.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Later we turn the gravity off and float over Ship's bottom eye, looking down at the

planet Shar had Ship find. It's blue like Marilyn Monroe's eyes.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;It's

water,&quot; Shar says. His arms are wrapped around my waist, his breasts

pressed against my back. He rests his chin on my shoulder.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I grunt.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;It's

water all the way down,&quot; he says. &quot;You could swim right through the

planet to the other side.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Did anyone live here?&quot; </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I think so. I don't remember. But it was a gift from a Sultan to her

beloved.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

and I have an enormous amount of information stored in our brains. The brain is

a sphere the size of a billiard ball somewhere in our bodies, and however much

we change our bodies, we can't change that. Maka once told me that even if Ship

ran into a star going nine-tenths lightspeed, my billiard-ball brain would come

tumbling out the other side, none the worse for wear. I have no idea what kind

of matter it is or how it works, but there's plenty of room in my memory for

all the stories of all the worlds in the Galaxy, and most of them are probably

in there. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >But

we're terrible at accessing the factual information. A fact will pop up

inexplicably at random -– the number of Quantegral Loverboys ever

manufactured, for instance, which is 362,476 -– and be gone a minute later, swimming

away in the murky seas of thought. That's the way Maka built us, on purpose. She

thought it was cute.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >3.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >An old argument about Maka:</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;She

loved us,&quot; I say. I know she did.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

rolls his eyes (he's a tiger at the moment).</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I could feel it,&quot; I say, feeling stupid.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Now

there's a surprise. Maka designed you from scratch, including your feelings,

and you feel that she loved you. Amazing.&quot; He yawns, showing his fangs.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;She made us more flexible than any other Loverboys. Our minds are almost

Interpreter-level.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He snorts. &quot;We were trade goods, Narra. Trade goods. Classy purchasable or

rentable items.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I curl up around myself. (I'm a python).</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;She set us free,&quot; I say.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar doesn't say anything for a while, because that is, after all, the central

holiness of our existence. Our catechism, if you like.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Then

he says gently: &quot;She didn't need us for anything anymore, when they went

into the Core.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;She could have just turned us off. She set us free. She gave us Ship.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He doesn't say anything.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;She loved us,&quot; I say.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I know it's true.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >4.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I don't tell Shar, but that's one reason I want us to go back to the Galactic

Core: Maka's there.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

know it's stupid. There's nothing left of Maka that I would recognize. The

Wizards got hungrier and hungrier for processing power, so they could think

more and know more and play more complicated games. Eventually the only thing

that could satisfy them was to rebuild their brains as a soup of black holes.

Black hole brains are very fast. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

know what happens when a person doesn't have a body any more, too. For a while

they simulate the sensations and logic of a corporeal existence, only with

everything perfect and running much faster than in the real world. But their

interests drift. The simulation gets more and more abstract and eventually

they're just thoughts, and after a while they give that up, too, and then

they're just numbers. By now Maka is just some very big numbers turning into

some even bigger numbers, racing towards infinity.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I know because she told me. She knew what she was becoming.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I still miss her.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >5.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We go down to the surface of the planet, which we decide to call Droplet. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

sky is painterly blue with strings of white clouds drifting above great choppy

waves. It's lovely. I'm glad Shar brought us here.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We're

dolphins. We chase each other across the waves. We dive and hold our breaths,

and shower each other with bubbles. We kiss with our funny dolphin noses.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I'm

relaxing and floating when Shar slides his rubbery body over me and clamps his

mouth onto my flesh. It's such a long time since I've been a cetacean that I

don't notice that Shar is a <i>boy</i> dolphin until I feel his penis enter me.

I buck with surprise, but Shar keeps his jaws clamped and rides me. Rides me

and rides me, as I buck and swim, until he ejaculates. He makes it take extra

long.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Afterwards we race, and then I am floating, floating, exhausted and happy as the sunset

blooms on the horizon.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >It's a <u>very</u> impressive sunset, and I kick up on my tail to get a better look.

I change my eyes and nose so I can see the whole spectrum and smell the entire wind.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >It hits me first as fear, a powerful shudder that takes over my dolphin body,

kicks me into the air and then into a racing dive, dodging and weaving. Then it hits me as knowledge, the signature written in the sunset: uranium-236, mandelium, large-scale entanglement from muon dispersal. Nuclear and strange-matter weapons fallout. Warboys.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Ship dropped us a matter accelerator to get back up with, a series of rings floating

in the water. I head for it.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar catches up and hangs on to me, changing into a human body and riding my back.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Ssh, honey,&quot; he says, stroking me. &quot;It's okay. There haven't been Warboys

here for ten thousand years...&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I buck his off, and this time I'm not flirting. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

changes his body below the waist back into a dolphin tail, and follows. As soon

as he is in the first ring I tell Ship to bring us up, and one dolphin, one

mermaid, and twelve metric tons of water shoot through the rings and up through

the blue sky until it turns black and crowded with stars.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Ten thousand years,&quot; says Shar as we hurtle up into the sky.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;You

<u>picked</u> a planet Warboys had been on! Ship must have seen the

signature.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Narra,

this wasn't a Warboy duel – they wouldn't dick around with nuclear for that.

They must have been trying to exterminate a civilian population.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The water has all sprayed away now and we are tumbling through the thin air of the

stratosphere. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;There's a chance they failed, Narra. Someone might be here, hidden. That's why we

came.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Warboys don't fail!&quot; </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We grow cocoons as we exit the atmosphere and hit orbit. After a couple of

minutes, I feel Ship's long retrieval pseudopod slurp me in.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I lie in the warm cave of Ship's retrieval pseudopod. It's decorated with webs of

green and blue. I remember when Shar decorated it. It was a long time ago, when we were first traveling.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I turn back into a human form and sit up. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar is lying nearby, picking at the remnants of his cocoon, silvery strands draped

across his breasts.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;You want to die,&quot; I say.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Don't be ridiculous, Narra.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Shar, seriously. It's not enough for you -- I'm not enough for you. You're looking

for Warboys. You're trying to get killed.&quot; I feel a buzzing in my head, my

breathing is constricted, aches shoot through my fist-clenched knuckles: clear

signs that my emotional registers are full, the excess externalizing into pain.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He sighs. &quot;Narra, I'm not that complicated. If I wanted to die, I'd just turn

myself off.&quot; He grows legs and stands up.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;No,

I don't think you can.&quot; What I'm about to say is unfair, and too horrible.

I'll regret it. I feel the blood pounding in my ears and I say it anyway:

&quot;Maybe Maka didn't free us all the way. Maybe she just gave us to each

other. Maybe you can't leave me. You want to, but you can't.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >His eyes are cold. As I watch, the color drains out of them, from black to slate

gray to white. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He looks like he wants to say a lot of things. Maybe: you stupid sentimental

little boy. Maybe: it's you who wants to leave -- to go back to your precious Maka, and if you had the brains to become a Wizard you would. Maybe: I want to live, but not the coward's life you keep insisting on.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He doesn't say any of them, though. He turns and walks away.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >6.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

keep catching myself thinking it, and I know he's thinking it too. This person

before me is the last other person I can reach, the only one to love me from

now on in all the worlds of time. How long until he leaves me, as everyone

else has left?</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >And how long can I stand his if he doesn't?</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >7.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

last people we met were a religious sect who lived in a beautiful crystal ship

the size of a moon. They were Naturals and had old age and death and even

children whom they bore themselves, who couldn't walk or talk at first or

anything. They were sad for some complicated religious reason that Shar and I

didn't understand. We cheered them up for a while by having sex with the ones

their rules allowed to have sex and telling stories to the rest, but eventually

they decided to all kill themselves anyway. We left before it happened.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Since then we haven't seen anyone. We don't know of anywhere that has people left. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

told Shar we could be passing people all the time and not know it. People

changed in the Dispersal, and we're not Interpreters. There could be people

with bodies made of gas clouds or out of the spins of elementary particles. We

could be surrounded by crowds of them.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He said that just made him sadder. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >8.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We go

down to Droplet again. I smile and pretend it's all right. We spent a thousand

years, our time, getting here; we might as well look around.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We

change ourselves so we can breathe water, and head down into the depths. There

are no fish on Droplet, no coral, no plankton. I can taste very simple

nanomites, the standard kind every made world has for general upkeep. But all I

see, looking down, is green-blue fading to deep blue fading to rich indigo and

blackness.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Then there's a tickle on my skin.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I stop swimming and look around. Nothing but water. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The tickle comes again.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I send a sonar pulse to Shar ahead, telling him to wait. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I try

to swim again but I can't. I feel fingers, hands, holding me, where there is

only water. Stroking, pressing against my skin.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

change into a hard ball, Shivol'riargh without head or limbs, and turn down

tactile until I can't tell the hands from the gentle current.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

fiddle with my perceptions until I remember how to send out a very fine sonar

wave, and to enhance and filter the data, discerning patterns in very fine

perturbations of the water. I subtract out the general currents and chaotic

swirls of the ocean, looking only for the motions of the water that should not

be there, and turn it into a three-dimensional image of the space around me. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >There are people here.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Their

shapes -– made of fine motions of the water –- are human shapes, tall, with

graceful oblong heads that flatten at the top to a frill. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >They

are running their watery hands over the surface of me, poking and prodding.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >From

below, Shar is returning, approaching me. Some of the water people cluster

around him and stop him, holding his arms and legs. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He struggles. I cannot see his expression through the murk.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The name &quot;Nereids&quot; swims up from the hidden labyrinths of my memory. Not

a word from this world, but word enough.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The Nereids back away, arraying themselves as if formally, three meters away from

me on all sides. A sphere of Nereids surrounds me. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar stops struggling. They let his go, pushing his outside the sphere. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >One

of the Nereids -– tall, graceful, broad-shouldered -– breaks out of the

formation and glides toward me. She places her hands on my surface.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >This,

I tell myself to remember, is what we were designed for. Alone among the

Quantegral Loverboys, Shar and I were given the flexibility and intelligence

to serve all the possible variations of post-Dispersal humanity. We were

designed to discover, at the very least, how to give pleasure; and perhaps even

how to communicate.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Still, I am afraid.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I let

the hard shell of Shivol'riargh grow soft, I sculpt my body back towards basic

humanity; tall, thin, like the Nereids.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >This

close, my sonar sees the face shaped out of water smile. The Nereid raises her

hands, palms out. I place my palms on them, though I feel only a slight

resistance in the water. I part my lips. The Nereid's head cautiously inches

toward mine.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I close my eyes and raise my face, slowly, slowly, to meet the Nereid's. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We kiss. It is a tickle, a pressure, in the water against my lips.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Our

bodies drift together. When the Nereid's chest touches my breasts, I register

shock: the resistance of the water is denser. It feels like a body is pressing

into mine. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The kiss goes on. Gets deeper. A tongue of water plays around my tongue.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I wonder what Shar is thinking.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Nereid releases my hands; her hands run slowly from the nape of my neck, across

my shoulder blades, down the small of my back, fanning out to hold my buttocks.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

open my eyes. I see only water, endless and dark, and Shar silent and still

below. I smile down to reassure him. He does not move. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >My

new lover is invisible. In all his many forms, Shar is never invisible. It is

as if the ocean is making love to me. I like it.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

familiar metamorphosis of sex in a human body overtakes me. Hormones course

through my blood; some parts grow wet, others (my throat) grow dry. My body is

relaxing, opening. My heart thunders. Fear is still there, for what do I know

of the Nereid? Pleasure is overwhelming it, like a torrent eroding granite into

silt.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >A

data channel crackles, and I blink with surprise. Through the nanomites that

fill the sea, the Nereid is sending. Out of the billions of ancient protocols I

know, intuition finds the right one.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Spreading

me open with its hand, the Nereid asks: <u>May I?</u><i></i></span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >A

double thrill of surprise and pleasure courses through me: first, to be able to

communicate so easily, and second, to be asked. <u>Yes</u>, I say over the same

archaic protocol. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >A

burst of water, a swirling cylinder strong and fine, enters me, pushing into

the warm cavity that once evolved to fit its prototype, in other bodies on

another world. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I hold the Nereid tight. I buck and move.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Empty blue surrounds me. The ocean fucks me.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

raise the bandwidth of my sensations and emotions gradually, and the Nereid

changes to match. Her skin swirls and dances against mine, electric. There is a

small waterspout swirling and thrashing inside me. The body becomes a wave,

spinning me, coursing over me, a giant caress. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I allow the pleasure to grow until it eclipses rational thought and the

sequential, discursive mode of experience.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The dance goes on a long time.</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;That's not the point, Shar. We don't know those creatures.&quot; The tendrils of his

hair reach for me. I draw back. &quot;It might not have been safe.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;You didn't look worried.&quot;</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The Nereids seem content to ignore Shar, and he seems content to be ignored. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I descend to them again and again. The same Nereid always comes to me, and we

make love.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >How did you come to this world?</span></u><span > I ask in an interlude.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >Once there was a Sultan who was the scourge of our people</span></u><span >, she tells me. <u>The last of us sought refuge here on her favorite husband's pleasure world. We were discovered by the Sultan's terrible warriors. </u></span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >They destroyed all life here, but we escaped to this form. The Warriors seek us

still, but they can no longer harm us. If they boil this world to vapor, we

will be permutations in the vapor. If they annihilate it to light, we will be

there in the coherence and interference of the light.</span></u></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >But you lost much</span></u><span >, I tell her.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >We

gained more. We did not know how much.</span></u><span > Her hands

have, if you were one of us.</u></span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I shiver with the pleasure of the caress and with the strangeness of the idea. <u></u></span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Her hands flicker over me: hands, then waves, then hands. <u>You would lose this

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I nestle against her, take her hands in mine to stop their flickering caress.

Thinking of Maka, thinking of Shar.</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;It's time to go, Narra,&quot; Shar says. His seaweed hair is thicker, tangled; he

is mostly seaweed, his Kelpie body a dark green doll hidden in the center.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I don't want to go,&quot; I say.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;We've seen this world,&quot; he says. &quot;It only makes us fight.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I am silent, drifting.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The water rolls around us. I feel sluggish, a little cold. I've been under for so

long. I grow some green Kelpie tresses myself, so I can soak up energy from the sun.</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >We both know I've fallen in love.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Before Maka freed us, when the Wizards had bodies, when we were slaves to the pleasure

of the Wizards and everyone they wanted to entertain, we fell in love on

command. We felt not only lust, but pure aching adoration for any guest or

client of the Wizards' who held the keys to us for an hour. It was the worst

part of our servitude.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >When Maka freed us, when she gave us the keys to ourselves, Shar burned the

falling-in-love out of himself completely. He never wanted to feel that way again.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I kept it. So sometimes I fall, yes, into an involuntary servitude of the heart. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I look up into the dappled white and blue of the sky, and then I tune my eyes so I can

see the stars beyond it.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I have given up many lovers for Shar, moved on with his into that night.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >But maybe this is the end of the line. Perhaps, if I abandon the Nereids, there is

no falling-in-love left in this empty, haunted Galaxy with anyone but Shar.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Who does not fall in love. Not even with me.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I'm going back to Ship,&quot; Shar says. &quot;I'll be waiting there.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I say nothing.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He doesn't say, but not forever.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He doesn't say, decide.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I float, soaking the sun into my green seaweed hair, but I can't seem to stop

feeling cold. I hear Shar splashing away, the splashes getting fainter.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >My tears diffuse into the planet sea.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >After a while I feel the Nereid's gentle hands pulling me back down. I sink with her,

away from the barren sky.</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >12.</span></p>


<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I lie in the Nereid's arms. Rocked as if by the ocean.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I turn off my sense of the passing of time.</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I emerge slowly from my own depths, letting time's relentless march begin again.

My eyes open.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Above, the blue just barely fades to clearer blue.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >As I

hit the surface I hear Shar's cry. Ship is directly overhead, and the signal is

on a tight beam. It says: <u>Narra! Too late. Tell your friends to hide you.</u></span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I shape myself into a disk and suck data from the sky. <u>What?</u> I yell back

at him, confused and terrified.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Then

dawn slices over the horizon of Droplet, and Shar's signal abruptly cuts off.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Warboy ship, rising with the sun, is massive and evil, translucent and blazing

white, subtle as a nova, gluttonous, like a fanged fist tearing open the sky.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >They

are approaching Droplet from its sun -- they must have been hidden in the sun's

photosphere. Otherwise Ship would have seen them before.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Run, Shar, I think, desperate. Ship is fast, probably faster than the Warboys'

craft.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >But Ship awaits the Warboys, silent, perched above Droplet's atmosphere like a

sparrow facing down an eagle.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Let

us remake you&quot;, the Nereid's voice whispers from the waves, surprising me.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;And

Shar?&quot; I say.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Too late,&quot; says the liquid, splashing voice.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Warboys.

The word is too little for the fanged fist in the sky. And I am without Shar,

without Ship. I look at my body and I realize I am allowing it to drift between

forms. It's like ugly gray foam, growing now spikes, now frills, now fingers. I

try to bring it under control, make it beautiful again, but I can't. I don't

feel anything, but I know this is terror. This is how I really am: terrified

and ugly.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >If I

send a signal now, the Warboys will know Droplet is not deserted. Perhaps I can

force the Nereids to fight them somehow.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

make myself into a dish again, prepare to send the signal.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Then

we will hide you in the center,&quot; says the liquid voice.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >Shar</span></u><span >, I say, but only to myself. I do not send the signal that would

bring death down upon me.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I abandon him.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Nereids pull me down, into the deep. I do not struggle. The water grows dark.

Above there is a faint shimmering light where Shar faces the Warboys alone. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar,

my brother, my husband. Suddenly the thought of losing his is too big for me to

fathom. It drowns out every other pattern in my brain. There are no more

reasons, no more explanations, no more Narra at all, no Droplet, no Nereids, no

universe. Only the loss of Shar.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

glimmer above fades. After a while the water is superdense, jellylike, under

the pressure of the planet's weight; it thickens into a viscous material as

heavy as lead, and here, in the darkness, they bury me.</span></p>

he says. &quot;What am I dealing with here?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Those,&quot;

says Ship, &quot;are some of our brothers, Shar. Definitely Wizard manufacture,

about a half a million years old in our current inertial frame; one Celestial

Dreadnought's worth of Transgenerate, Polystatic Cultural-Death Warboys. I'm

guessing they were the Palace Guard of the Sultanate of Charles-Fuentes-Parador,

a cyclic postcommunalist meta-nostalgist empire/artwork, which --&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Stay

with the Warboys, Ship,&quot; Shar says. &quot;What can they do?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Their

intelligence and tactical abilities are well above yours. But they're

culturally inflexible. As trade goods, they were designed to imprint on the

purchaser's cultural matrix and adhere to it -- in typically destructive Warboy

style. This batch shouldn't have outlasted the purchasing civilization, so they

must have gone rogue to some degree.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Do they have emotions?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Not

at the moment,&quot; Ship says. &quot;They have three major modes: Strategic,

Tactical, and Ceremonial. In Ceremonial mode -- used for court functions,

negotiations, entertainment and the like -- they have a full human

emotional/sensorial range. In Ceremonial Mode they're also multicate, each

Warboy pursuing his own agenda. Right now they're patrolling in Tactical Mode,

which means they're one dumb, integrated weapon -- like that they have the

least mimetic drift, which is probably how they've survived since the destruction

of the Sultanate.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Okay,

now shut up and let me think,&quot; Shar says and presses his fingers to his

temples, chasing some memories he can just barely taste through the murky

labyrinth of his brain.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

takes the form of a beautiful, demihuman queen. He speaks in a long-dead

language, and Ship broadcasts the signal across an ancient protocol.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Jirur

Na'alath, Sultana of the Emerald Night, speaks now: I am returned from my

meditations and demand an accounting. Guards, attend me!&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Warboy ship advances, but a subtle change overtakes it; rainbows ripple across

its white surface, and the emblem of a long-defunct Sultanate appears

emblazoned in the sky around it; the Warboys are in Ceremonial Mode.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;So far so good,&quot; says Shar to Ship.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Watch out,&quot; says Ship. &quot;They're smarter this way.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Warboys' signal reaches back across the void, and Ship translates it into a

face and a voice. The face is golden, fanged, blazing; the voice deep and full

of knives, a dragon's voice.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Prime

Subject of the Celestial Dreadnought <u>Ineffable Violence</u> speaks now: I

Sultana Na'alath.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Your

prayers are answered, Prime Subject,&quot; Shar announces. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><u><span >Ineffable

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar stamps his foot impatiently. 
&quot;Why do you continue to doubt me? Has my Ship

not transmitted to you signatures and seals of great cryptographic complexity

that establish who I am? Prime Subject, it is true that I am kind, but your

insolence tests the limits of my kindness.&quot;</span></p>

<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;And

meters separate Ship's protean hull from the shining fangs of the Dreadnought.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar's

eyes blaze. &quot;Have you no sense of propriety left, that you would challenge

me? Have you so degraded?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Warboy's eyes almost twinkle. &quot;The last Sultana who graced <u>Ineffable

Violence</u> with her sacred presence left me this gem.&quot; His ghostly

image, projected by Ship, holds up a ruby. &quot;At its core is a plasm of

electrons in quantum superposition. Each of the Sultanas retired to meditation 
has one like it; and in each gem are particles

entangled with the particles in every other gem.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Uh

oh,&quot; says Ship.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I

prized mine very much,&quot; says Shar. &quot;Alas, it was taken from me by

--&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;How

sad,&quot; says Prime Subject.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

fangs of <u>Ineffable Violence</u> plunge into Ship's body, tearing it apart.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Ship

screams.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Through

the exploding membranes of Ship's body, through the fountains of atmosphere

escaping, three Warboys in ceremonial regalia fly towards Shar. They are three

times his size, golden and silver armor flashing, weapons both archaic and

sophisticated held in their many hands. Shar becomes Shivol'riargh, who does

not need air, and spins away from them, towards the void outside. Fibers of

some supertough material shot out and ensnare him; he tries to tear them with

his claws, but cannot. One fiber stabs through his skin, injects him with a

nanomite which replicates into his central configuration channels; it is a

block, crude but effective, that will keep him from turning himself off.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

Warboys haul him, bound and struggling, into the <u>Ineffable Violence</u>.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime

Subject floats in a spherical room at the center of the Dreadnought with the

remaining two Warboys of the crew. The boarding party tethers Shar to a line in

the center of the room. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Most

impressive, Your Highness,&quot; Prime Subject says. &quot;Who knew that

Sultana Na'alath could turn into an ugly black spider?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Three

of the Warboys laugh; two others stay silent. One of these, a tall one with red

glowing eyes, barks a short, high-pitched communication at Prime Subject. It is

encrypted, but Shar guesses the meaning: stop wasting time with theatrics.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime

Subject says: &quot;You see what an egalitarian crew we are here. Vanguard Gaze

takes it upon himself to question my methods of interrogation. As well he

should, for it is his duty to bring to the attention of his commander any

apparent inefficiency his limited understanding leads him to perceive.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime

Subject floats toward Shar. He reaches out with one bladed hand, gently, as if

to stroke him, and drives the blade deep into his flesh. Shar lets out a

startled scream, and turns off his tactile sense.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;It

was an impressive performance,&quot; he says. &quot;I'm pleased you engaged us

in that little charade with the Sultana. In Tactical Mode we are more

efficient, but we have no appreciation for the conquest of booty.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;You'd

better hurry back to Tactical Mode,&quot; Shar says. &quot;You won't survive

long except as a mindless weapon. You won't last long as people.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He

does not react, but Shar notices a stiffening in a few of the others. It is

only a matter of a millimeter, but he was built to discern every emotional

nuance in his clients.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Oh,

we'll want to linger in this mode a while.&quot; Reaching through the crude

nanomite block in Shar's central configuration channels, he turns Shar's tactile

sense back on. &quot;Now that we have a Quantegral Loverboy to entertain

us.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He twists the blade and Shar screams again.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Please. Please don't.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I

had a Quantegral Loverboy once,&quot; he says in a philosophical, musing tone.

&quot;It was after we won the seventh Freeform Strategic Bloodbath, among the

Wizards. Before we were sold.&quot; His fanged face breaks into a grin.

&quot;I'm not meant to remember that, you know, but we've broken into our

programming. We serve the memory of the Sultanas out of <u>choice</u> -- we are

free to do as we like.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

laughs hoarsely. &quot;You're not free!&quot; he says. &quot;You've just gone

crazy, defective. You weren't meant to last this long -- all the other Warboys

are dead --&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Another

blade enters him. This time he bites back the scream.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;We

lasted because we're better,&quot; Prime Subject says.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Frightened

little drones,&quot; he hisses, &quot;hiding in a sun by a born-human's bauble

planet, while the real Warboys fought their way to glory long ago.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He

sees the other Warboys stir; Vanguard Gaze and a dull, blunt, silver one

exchange a glance. Their eyes flash a silent code. What do they think of their

preening, sensualist captain, who has wasted a half a million years serving a

dead civilization? </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;<u>I'm</u>

free,&quot; Shar says. &quot;Maka set me free.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Oh,

but not for long,&quot; Prime Subject says.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar's

eyes widen.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;We

want the keys to you. Surrender them now, and you spare yourself much agony.

Then you can do what you were made to do -- to serve, and to give

pleasure.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

recognizes the emotion in Prime Subject's posture, in his burning eyes: lust. That other

Loverboy half a million years ago did his job well, Shar thinks, to have

planted the seed of lust in this aging, mad Warboy brain. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >One

of the Warboys turns to go, but Prime Subject barks a command, insisting on the

ritual of sharing the booty.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

takes a soft, vulnerable, human form. &quot;I can please you without giving you

the keys. Let me try.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;The

keys, robot!&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

flinches at the ancient insult. &quot;No! I'm free now. I won't go back. I'd

rather die!&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;That,&quot;

says Prime Subject, &quot;is not one of your options.&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

cries. It's not an act.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime Subject

stabs him again.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Wait

-- &quot; Shar says. &quot;Wait -- listen -- one condition, then yes --&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime Subject

chuckles. &quot;What is it?&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

leans forward against his bonds, his lips straining towards the Warboy.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;I

was owned by so many,&quot; he says. &quot;For a night, an hour -- I can't go

back to that. Please, Prime Subject -- let me be yours alone --&quot;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

fire burns brightly in Prime Subject's eyes. The other Warboys are deadly still.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >He turns and looks at Vanguard Gaze.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&quot;Granted,&quot;

he says. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

gives Prime Subject the keys to his mind.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime Subject

tears him from the web of fibers. He fills Shar's mind with desire for him and

fear of him. He slams Shar's sensitivity to pain and pleasure to its maximum. He

plunges his great red ceremonial phallus into him.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Shar

screams.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Prime

Subject must suspect his crew is plotting mutiny. He must be confident that he

can humiliate them, keeping the booty for himself, and yet retain control. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >But

Shar is a much more sophisticated model than the Quantegral Loverboy Prime Subject had

those half a million years before. So Prime Subject is overtaken with pleasure,

distracted for an instant. Vanguard Gaze seizes his chance and acts.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >But

Vanguard Gaze has underestimated his commander's cunning.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Hidden

programs are activated and rush to subvert the Dreadnought's systems. Hidden

defenses respond. Locked in a bloody exponential embrace, the programs seize

any available means to destroy each other.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

escalation takes only a few microseconds.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >15.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I am

in the darkness near the center of the planet, in the black water thick as lead,

knowing Shar was all I ever needed.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Then

the blackness is gone, and everything is white light.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >The

outside edges of me burn. I pull into a dense, hard ball, opaque to everything.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Above

me, Droplet boils.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >&nbsp;</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left;text-indent:0cm"><span >16.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >It

takes a thousand years for all the debris in orbit around Droplet to fall into

the sea.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

shun the Nereids and eventually they leave me alone.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >At

last I find the sphere, the size of a billiard ball, sinking through the dark

water.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >My

body was made to be just one body: protean and polymorphic, but unified. It

doesn't want to split in two. I have to rewire everything. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Slowly,

working by trial and error, I connect the new body to Shar's brain. </span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Finally,

I am finished but for the awakening kiss. I pause, holding the silent body made

from my flesh. Two bodies floating in the empty, shoreless sea.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >Maka,

I think, you are gone, but help me anyway. Let him be alive and sane in there.

Give me Shar again.</span></p>



<p align="left"  style="text-align:left"><span >I

touch my lips to his. </span></p>
