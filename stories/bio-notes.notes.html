<dl><dt>PlausFab-Wisconsin </dt><dd> wiscon</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt>World’s Only Gynarchist Plausible-Fable Assembly </dt><dd> world's only feminist science fiction convention</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"Taken from The Scarlet Pimpernel?" </dt><dd> at the time of writing the story I had only read excerpts, and thought that my namesake was an anti-Semitic caricature bit part. This time the in-joke is on me, since he's actually the Scarlet Pimpernel in disguise</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"I had received an assignment </dt><dd> to construct a plausible-fable of a world without zeppelins" - of course, at Wiscon, I got the opposite assignment, from Dave Moles</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>“I enjoyed your ‘Droplet’ greatly.” </dt><dd> the joke here being that that story is set so far in the future that it could be an SF story written in either world</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"I am experimenting with a new form, in which a single point of divergence in history leads to a new causal chain of events," </dt><dd> my alter ego is inventing the traditional kind of alternate history, while the standard form in his world is the kind of story he is in</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Karen Despair Robinson </dt><dd> here I merged Karen Joy Fowler and Kim Stanley Robinson, who are good friends, into one person -- an homage to indicate how much this story owes to "The Years of Rice and Salt" (and that I'm a KJF fan; the two are also friends) </dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Howi Qomr Faukota </dt><dd> this is "Turtledove Turtledove Turtledove" in, I think, Arabic, Farsi and I forget what else. An homage to Harry Turtledove, a central figure in AH, who sometimes writes under a psuedonym of a semi-translation of his last name (Turteltaub)</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Sri Grigory Guptanovich Karthaganov </dt><dd> this is not an in-joke, though I wish it were</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"the exalted Lacrosse" </dt><dd> I miss playing Rugby. Lacrosse is supposed to have been derived from a Native American sport.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Frankish and Athapascan Moeity </dt><dd> in this chronology, the Native Americans retained a greater degree of sovereignty in North America; Europeans fled here under the pressure of Asian expansion, and, without support from an expansionist home country, made more compromises. </dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Malkat Ha-Shamayim </dt><dd> "Queen of Heaven", a Jewish folk mythic figure more important in this world's Judaism. (I know, I know, these aren't in-jokes, but this is fun anyway.)</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>pirates </dt><dd> were all the rage at that years' Wiscon</dd></dl>
<dl>

<dt>"In a yellow circle, two round black dots stared like unblinking demonic eyes; beneath, a black semicircle leered with empty, ravenous bonhomie." </dt><dd> y'all got that this is a smiley face, right? I always did like Alan Moore's Watchmen (an alternate history where pirates play an important role)</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"the dagger was knocked from my grasp by the recoil" </dt><dd> note that none of the protagonist's "rash and violent actions" are ever efficacious -- I thought that would be a nice change.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"or if a patternless and unforetellable Chance spared me all unknowing" </dt><dd> I suppose you could argue that this was a nod to Chance Morrison, who was at the Blue Heaven writing workshop with me, Paul and Charlie, on Lake Erie</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"a Heart-of-the-Sun reactor" </dt><dd> an Upanishadic nuclear reactor</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"the Israelite avatar of Vishnu, hanging on his cross" </dt><dd> Jesus of Nazareth having been subsumed, like Buddha before him, into the Hindu pantheon</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"I recalled that there had been a fancy-dress ball there, with a pirate theme" </dt><dd> a well-attended pirate-themed party that wiscon</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Chippewa Melko </dt><dd> while I was writing this, Paul Melko insisted on being put in it. He seemed like an excellent candidate for pirate, and does live not too far from Lake Erie.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"Dinky -— run and tell Max to drop the steamer." </dt><dd> At Blue Heaven, we came up with a proposed anthology of stories with ridiculous titled, to be called "The Bulimic Shortstop, and other stories". Among the stories were "Pirates of Lake Erie" and "Dinky the Little Cabin Boy Says 'Arr!'"</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>Gabriel Goodman </dt><dd> the psychiatrist protagonist of my story "The Death-Trap of Dr. Nefario"</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"The great Iowa poet, author of ‘Green Nakedness’ and ‘Broken Lines’?" </dt><dd> a real Benjamin Rosenbaum, who I used to find when ego-googling.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"‘Legs the Caterpillar’?" </dt><dd> a real Ben Rosenbaum, also found ego-googling, wrote this book.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"It is absurd to blame Ramasson for the war in Texas" </dt><dd> this of course is a cute inversion: Texas=Iraq, oil=helium. Apparently (Cory Doctorow once told me at a Worldcon Tor party) there is a huge amount of helium under Texas.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"No, my philosopher-hero would enjoy precisely those goods of which I was deprived—a happy family, a secure situation, a prosperous and powerful nation, a conciliatory nature; above all, an absence of immediate physical peril." </dt><dd> this, to my great gratitude, in fact describes me.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"He watches us with immeasurable compassion, though He will not act." </dt><dd> the mainstream Karaite Judaism of my alter ego's world, with which he is so dissatisfied, somewhat parallels my own liberal, postmodern religious sensibility, which asserts a Divine but expects no convenient miracles from it.</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"A diguanidinium compound produced by certain marine dinoflagellates" </dt><dd> thank you, Wikipedia!</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"thank Buddha, Thor, and Darwin" </dt><dd> now there's a robust polytheism for you!</dd></dl>
<dl>
<dt>"the prayer the ancient heretical Rabbis would say before death" </dt><dd> this of course is the Shma, which modern Jews do say before death, as well as on rising and going to sleep.</dd></dl>
<dl>

<p>One last note: At a party that wiscon where I received David Moles's assignment to write this story, I solicitied suggestions about what genre to make it in from those present (I recall Moles, Mary Anne Mohanraj, Tim Pratt, Heather Shaw [whom I suppose the George Bernard Shaw airship could be regarded an allusion to?], Susan Groppi, maybe Jed Hartman and Karen Meisner... who else? I'm surely forgetting someone). Suggested genres included, at a minimum: pirate adventure yarn, alternate history, Western, Victorian murder mystery, metafiction, and philosophical detective story. I tried to incorporate them all.</p>
