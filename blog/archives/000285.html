  Worldcon Schedule 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>I'm going to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WorldCon">World Science Fiction Convention</a> in Glasgow, where I get to find out if I won a <A href="https://www.interaction.worldcon.org.uk/hugo.htm">Hugo Award</a> for the <a href="https://www.allstarstories.com/rosenbaum-notes.html">zeppelin story</a>.</p>

<p>Hope to see you there.</p>

<p>In case you're going -- here's my schedule:</p>

<p><b>Friday, August 5</b><br />
~10:20 am  Arrive in Glasgow on a train from Edinburgh</p>

<p><b>Saturday, August 6</b><br />
12:00 noon Reading <blockquote>Here, I read something. I have half an hour. Requests? What should I read?</blockquote></p>

<p>7:00pm  Is Blogging Helping or Hurting Your Career? <blockquote>with Michael Cobley, Eileen Gunn, John Scalzi, Martha Wells. I am not too enthused about the stated topic, but the list of panelists sounds entertaining. My vote is to treat the official topic briefly, and then float off into conversational la-la land.</blockquote></p>

<p><b>Sunday, August 7</b><br />
12:00noon to 2:00pm  Hugo Rehearsal </p>

<p>1:00pm Autographing <blockquote>with Jay Caselberg, Anne McCaffrey, Bryan Talbot, Paul Witcover. My experience with signings has varied. Sometimes I have sat and read for an hour, undisturbed by autograph petitioners. Sometimes intense individuals have had me sign my bare name on my stories in many issues of digest magazines, which (they tell me when I ask) they have not read -- I feel kind of like a penny stock being bought "just in case" by a highly speculative investor. And sometimes my friends come by with copies of <a href="https://www.lcrw.net/smallbeer/chapbooks/benjaminrosenbaum.htm">Other Cities</a> (yay friends!). All of which are fine with me, and entertaining. <br/>And then sometimes, every once in a while, people I haven't met before come with something I wrote that they liked. And that is very, very nice.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>3:30pm Science Fiction Cities <blockquote>with Gary Ehrlich, Ian McDonald, Steve Saffel, Robert Silverberg. Ooo! This one sounds like fun!</blockquote></p>

<p>6.00pm Hugo Reception, Forth Room in Armadillo (Scottish Exhibition and Convention Centre)</p>

<p>8.00pm Hugo Ceremonies main theatre of the "Armadillo." </p>

<p>??? Hugo Loser's Party</p>

<p><b>Monday, August 8</b><br />
2:30pm train to Edinburgh</p>

<p>...thence to Switzerland!</p>

<p>"And then sometimes, every once in a while, people I haven't met before come with something I wrote that they liked. And that is very, very nice."</p>

<p>Alas, I go to college this weekend. I did meet you at the last WorldCon, and you signed my copy of Other Cities, but at that point I hadn't read it and liked it yet; I just thought you were neat, and then when you showed us (my friend and me) your chapbook I realized, "Oh, I got a copy of that the other day..." :)</p>

<p>But yes. Just wanted to say, I love your stories. Good luck with the Hugos.</p>

<p>Yes, this would be her friend. We realized at Boskone people don't seem to remember us unless we're together, so I figured I'd best comment as well.</p>

<p>(We followed Theodora Goss around like puppies and sat on the floor at the Strange Horizons tea party, if that jogs your memory.)</p>

<p>Much, much luck with the Hugo; you're one of my favorite current writers.</p>

<p>I totally remember you guys. Weren't we over in the corner of the tea party, with Kelly Link? And hadn't the two of you won some kind of scholarship to the con or student fiction award or something? </p>

<p>Thank you both for the kind words! </p>

<p><i>Alas, I go to college this weekend.</i></p>

<p>Now why exactly is that an "alas"? :-)</p>

<p>*grins* We went to the Alpha sf/f/h teen writers' workshop, where we met Thomas, who is friends with Dora (from either Clarion or Odyssey, I forget which) and told us we had to meet her.</p>

<p>I actually meant "that weekend," not "this weekend," and "alas" because it means that all sorts of fun people will be in Scotland while I get to be stressed out about collegeness.</p>

<p>Actually, our summer reading is Invisible Cities by Italo Calvino, and we're supposed to write something connecting it with another book, or movie, or piece of art...  so of course, I am going to write about Other Cities. Because I just have to. And no one else will have heard of it so then I get to make them all read it. *evil grin*</p>

<p>(And yay! You remember us! *feels cool* :)</p>

<p>I recall having a crazy, giddy, fun first week (some kind of Orientation Week, right?) of college... not entirely unlike a con. Enjoy it. Where are you going?</p>

<p>Wow, I'm psyched that you are using me for your essay... let me know how it goes... :-)</p>

<p>I'm going to Bard College, which is somewhere in New York state. (Geography is not my forte.) They do a three-week Workshop of Language and Thinking for first year students, which sounds fun and interesting. And one of my best friends (another Alphan, not Sarah) will be there, so that should be good. I'm just a worrier.</p>

<p>*smiles* I will certainly let you know how it goes. I'm glad you're psyched.</p>
