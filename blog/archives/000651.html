It is with great pleasure that I present the second book in <a href="http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/cgi-bin/works/ArthurMeetsAviva.pl">a continuing series </a>by my daughter Aviva. 
</p>

<p>(You will note that there was an interval -- of about six months -- between the composition of the first half and the last half.)</p>

<p>And now, without further ado...</p>

<p>Aviva's book is so carefully done. I love the twists and turns in the plot, and the wonderful, vivid illustrations. I can tell she put a lot of work and thought into it. I think Aviva did a particularly excellent job describing what "mad" feels like in her carefully-done purple word: MAD on page 6. It looks very mad.</p>

<p>What I particularly like was the attention to detail in tying in Grompy Poop at the very end again.</p>

<p>Aviva, I really enjoyed reading your book. The drawings are imaginative and colorful, and the story is very engaging. I hope you'll make another?</p>

<p>Ben, that's brilliant!  I particularly like that she's always showing, never telling.  It's vivid and engaging and mysterious and very funny.  Some adult writers I've met could learn a LOT from Aviva. :)</p>

<p>(It's also sort of existential.  I mean, what about grompy poop, in the larger scheme of things?  "Whatever."  Positively Sartrean--if one can be positively Sartrean.)</p>

<p>I liked both the title and when they call each other GROMPY POOP.</p>
