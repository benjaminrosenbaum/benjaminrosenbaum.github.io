<p>The good news: My moody meditation on love, loyalty, and marriage, or sex-crazed romp of erotic lesbian androids, or critique of the optimists of the Singularity, whichever way you want to read it, "Droplet", is now <A href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29789.htm">up on Fictionwise.com</a>, along with several other stories.</p>

<p>The bad news: Fictionwise doesn't seem to be letting people print my stories. I've asked them to enable printing. We'll see what they say. I really don't want to sell people eBooks that won't print. I mean, yuk.</p>

<p><b>Update:</b>Worse news -- Fictionwise just doesn't let you have printable PDFs. Saves on tech support costs, they say. Hmph. Anyone want to create a printable PDF of "Embracing-the-New" or "The Orange" or "Start the Clock"? I'll post it.</p>

<p><b>Further Update:</b>Emboldened by the comments below, I am nagging Fictionwise some more to see if they'll enable printing after all. Also, I note that my comical surrealist story, <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29790.htm">"Red Leather Tassels"</a>, is also up on Fictionwise. </p>

<p>"Just doesn't let you have printable PDFs"? How do they explain the fact that you get 833 results when you select "PDF" and "printing enabled" on their <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/servlet/mwsearch?t=search">advanced search</a> page?</p>

<p>I always print off my issues of F&SF that I buy on Fictionwise. Never had a problem.</p>

<p>Hmmmm! </p>

<p>Here's what FW told me:<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>"We disable printing for all our eBooks except public domain titles, which are printable as PDF because students like to print them and make notes for class, and because there are no copyright laws to protect.</i><br />
<i>We disable printing because it helps suppress illegal distribution of copyright protected works, and helps us avoid printer support requests:</i><br />
<i>"Hi, my name is Billy, and I can't get my Epson 1127a printer driver to work...."<br />
</i></blockquote></p>

<p>I am going to ask them about F&SF...</p>

<p>Ben, I sent you a copy of Embracing the New as a PDF.  Did you get it?</p>

<p>If you ever need a PDF of "Biographical Notes", let me know.</p>

<p>Another response from Fictionwise. F&SF and public domain works are exceptions -- they are always printable -- but their software is not set up to make an exception for an individual author. However, when they come out with their own Fictionwise Reader format, they are considering the option of letting authors choose to make their stories printable.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>And they are coming out with their own format why?</p>

<p><i>(Bangs head against wall. Sighs.)</i></p>

<p>Oh, never mind.</p>
