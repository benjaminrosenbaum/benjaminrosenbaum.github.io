<p>Various writing news:
<ul>
  <li> <p><a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/belongingoutsidebelonging">Dream Askew/Dream Apart</a>, a book containing two tabletop roleplaying games (queer speculative fiction and Jewish historical fantasy respectively), by me and renowned game designer Avery Alder (author of <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts">Monsterhearts</a> and <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/the-quiet-year">The Quiet Year</a>), is <b>up for three Ennies</b>, the tabletop gaming awards given out at GenCon. The book is nominated for Best Game, Best Setting, and Product of the Year.</p>

<p>If you want to vote ethically without buying a bunch of games, you can check out the free playtest kits for <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dream-Askew-Play-Kit.pdf">Dream Askew</a> and <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dream-Apart-Play-Kit.pdf">Dream Apart</a>, as well as free previews of many of its competitors. For instance, in the Best Game category, there is a <a href="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0070/1746/3923/files/Dialect_Preview.pdf?16616558453520862125">free preview of the stunning game of dying languages, Dialect</a>, a <a href="https://www.modiphius.net/collections/liminal/products/liminal-quickstart">free quickstart for the contemporary-Britian-bordering-the-Hidden-World fantasy game Liminal</a>, and a <a href="https://tuesdayknightgames.itch.io/mothership-players-survival-guide">pay-what-you-want version of the xenomorph-battling science fiction horror game Mothership</a>, all in PDF. Sadly I cannot find a free version of Companion's Tale , but there is an <a href="www.oneshotpodcast.com/one-shot/129-companions-tale/">actual play podcast episode</a> by the amazing One Shot group (who also played Dream Apart <a href="https://oneshotpodcast.com/one-shot/254-dream-apart-part-1/">in</a> <a href="https://oneshotpodcast.com/one-shot/255-dream-apart-part-2/">three</a> <a href="https://oneshotpodcast.com/one-shot/256-dream-apart-part-3/">episodes</a>). If you want to see what's new in tabletop games, you could do worse than reviewing the nominees... and you'd then have enough of an idea of them to fairly cast a vote. (The voting page also has links for the nominees in the other categories).</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ennie-awards.com/vote/2019/">Here's where to cast your votes.</a> It's fine to only vote in one or two categories. Only vote once, but pass the word on to your friends and nemeses.</p>

<li><p>I'm heading to New York next week! <ul>
   <li>On Wednesday July 17th, I'm <i>not</i> reading, but I am planning to catch Theodora Goss and Cadwell Turnbull reading at <a href="https://www.kgbfantasticfiction.org/upcoming-readers/">KGB</a>.
    <li>On Thursday July 18th, I <b>am</b> reading, together with <a href="https://www.karenheuler.com/">Karen Heuler</a>, at the magnificent Erewhon Literary Salon of my publisher, <a href="https://www.erewhonbooks.com/">Erewhon Books</a>. The salon sounds seriously fun, I am told there is often dinner and games as well as reading. You need to RSVP! <a href="https://bit.ly/ELS_19-07-18">Do so here!</a> </ul></p>
<li> My story "Rejoice, My Brothers and Sisters!" sold to F&SF, it will probably be in the Nov/Dec issue, possibly Jan/Feb. It's nice to be back in its pages, and lovely to work with Charlie Finlay again.
