  Moses and Miriam 
  </font>

<p>So at our family's seder we go around and tell the Passover story in our own words, right?</p>

<p>This year, Aviva (who also sang the intro to the Four Questions in pitch-perfect Aramaic -- well, with per-phrase prompting -- and cleared all the dishes, and generally had a great time and was delightful) told the story of Moses and Miriam, as follows:</p>

<p> "they wanted to kill the baby. but miriam said to her mommy, put him in a box. so they made a box. then miriam hid in the grass. she was little and she hid in the grass and her LITTLE BROTHER was in the box, um, um, um, and then this little princess came and she said 'I want a baby! But I dont have any milk!' and then Miriam JUMPED OUT and she said 'I know a woman who has milk!' and they got her and she gave the milk and it was MOSES'S MOMMY and then Moses grew up in the castle!"</p>

<p>Aviva is all about the saving little brothers from immanent peril.</p>

<p>Hey Ben</p>

<p>I think you mean "imminent peril" - "immanent" means "transcendant." Given that you're an eminent authority on the English language, I thought you should know...</p>

<p>The only reason I know this is I was playing a board game the other night, and I misdefined "immanent," myself...</p>

<p>Oops, good catch, Matt.</p>

<p>Upon reflection, I think Aviva did mention that the box (basket) was in a river.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Also, upon reflection, given that this is The Will of God we're talking about, the peril was in a sense transcendant. So maybe Aviva's about saving little brothers from immanent peril, after all...</p>

<p>As the older sister of two younger brothers--trust me, that impulse NEVER goes away! (Even when said younger brothers are a full foot taller than older sis, broad-shouldered, stronger, etc, etc...)</p>
