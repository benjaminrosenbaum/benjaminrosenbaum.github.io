<p>This conversation was reported to me from Switzerland:</p>

<p>Aviva: "Right, so mommy, when I die I'll just be a head and two feet"<br />
Esther, nonplussed: "What? Why do you say that?"<br />
Aviva: "Because I won't have my body. Your body is what's between your head and your feet."<br />
Esther: "No, honey, in this case your body is everything *including* your head and your feet."<br />
Aviva: (long pause)<br />
Aviva: What do you think that will be like, not having anything?</p>

<p>Of course this concerns my granddaughter, which makes it especially wonderful, but I also want to comment that Benjamin (my son), also at an early age said:  "Mommy, I think I just have hands and eyes and a brain."  "NO," I said, quite shocked, but understanding that those were the only body parts that mattered to someone who just liked to read, write and imagine, "you have arms and legs and a body too!"  It took many years, and the creation of my computer/sports day camp (which has a perfect mind/body balanced day) before Benjamin found more value in the rest of his body.  Now, he plays rugby!</p>

<p>Jeez, mom....</p>

<p>:-)</p>

<p>Interesting how our parents can instantly reduce us to adolescent squirming. </p>

<p>Mom's <a href="https://www.ticcamp.com">camp</a> is one of the best-run, most innovative, and most passionately adventurous educational institutions I have ever run across. You should go check it out if you have kids aged 7-16. However, I don't recall paying much attention to sports there. It seems to me that the first sign of a rapprochement between me and physical activity was our playing endless games of "Nail The Little Blue Bastard", a rule-less, savage, primal variant of racquetball, at <a href="https://www.jhu.edu/gifted/">geek camp</a> at around age 13...</p>

<p>Hi Ben and Ben's Mom!!</p>

<p>So Ben, when I read this about Aviva, I had to chuckle.  I would expect nothing else from Ben's children!  Good to see you're posting again.</p>

<p>Hi, Ben and Ben's Mom--</p>

<p>Aviva is an amazing creature.  I love to hear stories about her.</p>

<p>But it would be great to hear stories about Ben, too.  :-)</p>
