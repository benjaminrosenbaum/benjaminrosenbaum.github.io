In fact let us have <b><i>a little contest</i></b>: <div style="border: solid 1px black; padding: 5px; margin: 5px;"><center><b>Contest Rules</b></center><ol><li>Create a derivative work of any story in The Ant King and Other Stories <li>Place it under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">the same license</a> (you do this just by including a declaration to that effect on the work in its published form) <li>Post a link to the work (or some kind of recording or representation of the work, like a youtube video if it's a live performance, or a picture of it if it's, like, a vase or something) in the comments to this blog entry. <li>Derivative works can be translations, plays, movies, radio plays, audiobooks, flashmob happenings, horticultural installations, visual artworks, slash fanfic epics, robot operas, sequels, webcomics, ASCII art, text adventure games, roleplaying campaigns, knitting projects, handmade shoes, or <i>anything else you feel like</i>. <li> On <b>March 3, 2009</b> (that gives you six months), I will send signed (and extensively doodled-upon) <a href="http://lcrw.net/images/covers/rosenbaum_antking_hc_6x8.gif">hardcover</a> copies of The Ant King and Other Stories to the creators of the <i>three</i> derivative works that I like the best. <li>Obviously, other than what's covered in the CC license, <i>you retain all rights to your works</i>, so if you've made, you know, <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2006/20060904/house-f.shtml">House-Beyond-Your-Sky</a>-themed coasters, you get to sell them or put drinks on them to keep rings off your coffee table or whatever.

<p><li> At some point I'll do something a little fancier with the URL <a href="http://theantking.com">theantking.com</a>, but I don't want to get too distracted from <i>Resilience</i> at the moment... I'm having a <a href="http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTsBal7PIWFOKA36DdqBgDw">return to productivity</a> since Worldcon (thanks to all the stimulating conversations I had with all the wonderful people whom I have as usual completely failed to acknowledge in any kind of con report), and I don't want to get derailed...!</ul></p>

<p>Hi!  </p>

<p>I created a Mobipocket/Kindle version of <i>The Ant King</i> and <a href="http://www.spontaneousderivation.com/2008/09/04/from-the-ebookery-benjamin-rosenbaums-the-ant-king-and-other-stories/">posted it on my website.</a>  There are also a variety of screenshots of it from my Kindle.  <br />

<p>Hey Ben,</p>

<p>Just a heads up to your story Ant King. It's now live on the StarShipSofa. Show No 42 It's a fine narration, if I do say so myself. If there is a chance you can plug it any where... that would be way cool.</p>

<p>Hejsa!</p>

<p>Benjamin Rosenbanum allowed, nay, begged us to remix the Ant King.</p>

<p>So here you go: one remix coming up.</p>

<p>Basis: 'Biographical Notes to "A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-planes" by Benjamin Rosenbaum'. Reason: Springing from a need to highlight the places, where the teller ponders the tale, he will tell - and the tale, that tells him.</p>

<p>(Will come alive in a few hours.)</p>

<p>Hi!</p>

<p>You don't know me at all, but I read about your contest at Tor.com, and I've enjoyed many of your stories.  </p>

<p>Here's a short piece of electronic dance music, inspired by "The Orange."</p>

<p>Hey!</p>

<p>I made a few recordings of myself singing and playing guitar, I really liked the story and the name of A Siege Of Cranes so I named the "band" after it. You can listen here at:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>

<p>Ran up a Myspace page to publish a piece of literary criticism (actually, more fairly called literary interpretation)in narrative form of "A Siege of Cranes."</p>

<p>Not knowing any better I just slapped it into the blog page.</p>

<p>I liked the "Other Cities" so much when I saw them on Strange Horizons that I wrote one myself; it's here http://aarondamommio.blogspot.com/2009/01/my-other-city-quall.html</p>

<p>My free-to-reproduce contribution is a derivative joke, I'm not web savvy so I'll place it here.</p>

<p>The author-surrealist Benjamin Rosenbaum, struggling to come up with a devilishly dramatic denouement to his latest book, 'The Riddle of the Ant King', hits upon a novel idea: let the readership write the last chapter, the best effort to win a prize -- a signed copy of the completed second edition.<br />
The book's publisher, Small Beer Press, in spite of their reservations, goes along with the scheme.<br />
A week after publication Rosenbaum, off piste, receives a transatlantic phonecall. 'This is awfull!' decries the head honcho at Small Beer, 'We've had over 200 e-complaints, saying it's outrageous that 'The Riddle of the Ant King' has no ending. They are demanding their money back.'<br />
   'And how many e-submissions did we get?'<br />
   'About the same number'<br />
   'Well then,' says Rosenbaum cheerfully, 'delete the names and addresses and e-mail those endings to the complainers!'</p>

<p>This is in regard to the derivative work on the Ant King contest. I've been thinking of it for a long time, but it hasn't fully materialized; so I thought an blog post would be better than nothing at all.</p>

<p>I was putting together plans for an Ant King Tarot -- the suits would be gumballs, blimps... I haven't sorted the other two (Wisdom Ants, perhaps?). Some of the Major Arcana are pleasantly obvious: The Ant King as the Hierophant; Matthias as The Hermit; the Orange as The World, The White Witch's Chariot. And even "Benjamin Rosenbaum", the plausible-fabulist, as the Fool.</p>

<p>My artistic skills are not up to the task of designing such a deck. As well, perhaps fully filling in the slots of the deck from the images of B. Rosenbaum's imagined worlds is too much, and it's better to let this remain a dream of possibility, a fabulous and non-existent thing.<br />
