  Saving up my willpower 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>In the midst of our busy Friday (before picking up Aviva at her piano lesson to rush her across town by bicycle to her trapeze lesson), Noah and I are in the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/koscher-laden-basel">Koscher-Laden</a> buying champagne and juice for <a href="http://www.liberaljudaism.org/rabbi_bb.htm">Rabbi Barbara Borts</a>'s last service at Migwan.</p>

<p>As I'm paying, I'm chatting with the proprietors about Noah's Hebrew (he was reading the french fry package, haltinglly) and Migwan's afternoon Hebrew classes for kids. "Migwan has a school now?" they say, raising their eyebrows. They seem guardedly pleased -- and also tickled, as if by a juicy piece of gossip.</p>

<p>Then, I notice that Noah is sitting on the floor by the cash register, covering his eyes with his hands.</p>

<p>"Noah," I say, "what's up?"</p>

<p>"I'm trying not to look," Noah says.</p>

<p>"Why is that?" I ask.</p>

<p>"I'm saving up my willpower," Noah says.</p>

<p>Slightly confused, I search the immediate surroundings. The propreiors chuckle.</p>

<p>"Aha," I say, "you mean because there is candy here?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Noah, "and ice cream. Snickers." Taking his hands from his eyes, he points to the sign depicting a Snickers ice cream bar. It does look pretty good.</p>

<p>The propreitors and I smile indulgently. "And you are saving your willpower not to ask for any?"</p>

<p>"No," Noah says, somewhat annoyed. "I don't <i>want</i> any, because <i>I'm saving up my willpower</i>." </p>

<p>"Oh," I say, and pay for the champagne, and say goodbye to the proprietors. "Okay, well, we have watermelon in the trailer."</p>

<p>"I'm saving up my willpower for Migwan tonight," Noah says.</p>

<p>We go out. "I see," I say. "Well, there will be lots of good things to eat at Migwan tonight. You can save your appetite for those."</p>

<p>"Daddy," Noah says, "you don't get it. I'm not saving up my willpower so I can eat. I'm saving up my willpower because we're saying goodbye to Barbara tonight."</p>

<p>"Oh," I say, stopping in my tracks.</p>

<p>Noah waves his hands, underlining the obvious. "I don't want to collapse in the middle of the party!"</p>

<p>"You are avoiding sugar," I say, dumbfounded, "to manage your mood."</p>

<p>"Of course," says Noah, and gets in to the trailer.   </p>
