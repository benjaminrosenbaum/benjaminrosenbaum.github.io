Now that my Dad is retired, he is getting back to physics. He wandered away from the subject of quantum time around the time I was born, and apparently it has been waiting for him patiently. Enjoy:</p>

<p>Do you suppose you could recruit him to write a guest post? An "Ask Ben's Dad," maybe?</p>

<p>I am really really curious about this result that came out recently that 3+1-dimensional spacetime can be implied by a minimal structure of (2-dimensional) triangles with a causality direction as long as neighboring causalities are required to be aligned. It sounds like this might be close to his current field of interest, and how cool would it be to get that explanation from Benjamin Rosenbaum's father?</p>

<p>Alas, Dan, my Dad says that since he's been away from the field for 40 years, he no longer is really conversant with what's going on outside of his own niche. "I can still do follow up work on my own prior papers and I could still teach a freshman college course in mechanics and maybe a graduate course in elementary quantum mechanics or electromagnetic theory, but that's about it."</p>

<p>So you are going to have to find out about the causality triangles and get back to us.<br />
