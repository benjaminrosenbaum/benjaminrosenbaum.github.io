  Sweatshop in our attic 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>Aviva is into sewing now. In addition to various more ambitious projects, she has been mending rips in jeans, shirts, what have you. She charges a swiss franc -- 89 cents -- a rip... which seems fair as I have to thread the needle and untangle the occasional tangle.</p>

<p>Recently she was in the middle of some altercation with Noah when, just as things were heating up, she noticed that he had a rip in the knee of his jeans. "Noah!" she cried. "Can I sew that?" "Sure," he said, and took off his pants. She went in search of her sewing kit.</p>

<p>So then we were at the church of the in-laws, at the Suppentag, drinking our soup which was, according to the placemats, to raise money to do something about child labor. I felt obligated to raise Aviva's consciousness about the issue.</p>

<p>Me: You know, some kids have to work every day.</p>

<p>Aviva: Really? Can I do that?</p>

<p>Me: No, I mean, not like fun work, like they have to work all day. Like, 10 hour days.</p>

<p>Aviva: Sounds good to me!</p>

<p>Me: For very little money.</p>

<p>Aviva: How much exactly?</p>

<p>Me: Like, a dollar a day.</p>

<p>Aviva: A <i>whole</i> dollar? <i>Every </i> day?</p>

<p>Me: Doing difficult work in bad conditions, like, um, sewing soccer balls in poor lighting...</p>

<p>Aviva: WHAT?? You can SEW soccer balls? That is AWESOME!</p>

<p>Me: okay, the first ten soccer balls would be fun but after a thousand soccer balls you would be wishing you were back in school!</p>

<p>Aviva: LIKE THAT WOULD EVER HAPPEN!!!</p>
