It is time for us to play that ever-exciting game, "see how much more of a hippie I am than you!"</p>

<p>Ready? I'll go first:</p>

<p>My children think raw flax seeds are a decadent and delicious treat, sometimes preferable to chocolate.</p>

<p>Top that!</p>

<p>You win.  IF YOU CAN CALL IT THAT.</p>

<p>Jeremiah and I spent a thrilling half hour yesterday afternoon watching our local chocolatier make an assortment of gourmet chocolates in the kitchen ("chocolate factory") at the back of their shop.  Every step of the process was excitedly observed and discussed between us.  More fun than watching flax grow?  You decide!</p>

<p>I am not lying! I am arguably <i>spinning</i> a little. Aviva doesn't like chocolate, and is very excited about flax seeds (they are called "crunchies"). Noah likes them too, though he far prefers chocolate. </p>

<p>So "sometimes preferable" actually means "preferred by one out of two children". Sounds less impressive that way, I admit.</p>

<p>The apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Benjamin introduced ME to kale and other dark green veggies when he was about 5.  He never craved chocolate.</p>
