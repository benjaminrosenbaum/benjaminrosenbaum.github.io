<p>I'm really, really eager to know what people think of this experiment. The stories link to each other, and there should be a hanging-together-ness if you read the whole thing. </p>

<p>Thanks again to my excellent collaborators Chris, Greg, Kiini, Meghan, Tim, and Elad.</p>

<p>Ok, I have read them all now.  I liked many of them, some more than others, I enjoyed clicking from one story to another.  Some of them, though, seem more connected than others. Some I didn't understand. Some, I'm still trying to figure out what the disaster was, and read them again thinking, what am I missing here?</p>

<p>It's fun though.  <br />
Do it again. <br />
I feel like a teletubby. "Nochmals! Nochmals!"</p>

<p>Interesting point -- they don't necessarily actually all have a disaster. It perhaps bears mentioning that the title was the last thing we came up with. We really were just writing interconnected stories about anything, and noticed a theme of disaster running through many of the stories, and "23 small disasters" seemed amusingly self-deprecating. But perhaps it's more confusing...</p>
