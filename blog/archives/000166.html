<p>This is what happens when you let you daughter listen to your I-POD...she has always shown such great judgement!</p>

<p>Actually, she mostly hears my version. I sing a lot of classic rock, a capella, to Aviva on long car rides and while washing the dishes. Her previous favorite was "Pinball Wizard". :-)</p>

<p>As a member of a family with many teachers in it, I would think you should not prejudice your daughter against teachers.</p>

<p>Ah, but you see, I am not only from a family of teachers, but a family which is absolutely insistent on quality teaching -- and absolutely indignant about mind control and dark sarcasm in the classroom.</p>

<p>We talked a great deal about the song, and Aviva is quite clear that it is a song about a *bad* teacher. We talked about bad teachers and good teachers, and what I would do if she had a bad teacher. What I would do would depend on what the teacher had done that was bad -- and would range from getting the teacher fired, on one end of the spectrum, to singing Aviva her favorite Rolling Stones song (the one that goes "You Can't Always Get What You Want...") on the other.</p>

<p>Aviva hardly despises education (this is a girl you have to bribe into eating vegetables using math problems or teaching her how to say the vegetable names in French). But she's very clear that teachers have a lot of power, and that she'll be largely at their mercy when she goes to school (a few months of playgroup taught her that much). So there's definitely something uplifting for her about the idea that someone will tell the BAD teachers "hey, teacher, leave those kids alone!"</p>
