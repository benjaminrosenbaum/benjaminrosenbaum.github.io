My contribution to the blogosphere's response to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake">tsunami</a>...
</p><p>
Here's <a href="http://www.google.com/tsunami_relief.html">Google's tsunami relief page</a>, here's the <a href="http://tsunamihelp.blogspot.com/">Tsunami Blog</a> and <a href="http://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Tsunami_Help">Wiki</a>, and here is a table with ratings by watchdog organizations on the efficiency of the relief organizations most prominently mentioned, plus news:
<p>
(Since Charity Navigator's site seems to be having trouble with heavy load, I am adding links to the Google cache of their ratings, following the stars.)

These ratings do not necessarily tell the whole story. The efficiency ratings rely on the distinction between "administrative", "promotional", and "administrative" expenses: what constitutes "program" expenses may vary greatly from charity to charity. For instance, the <a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/4617.htm">United States Fund for UNICEF</a> gets four stars because 88.5% percent of its revenues go to "programs". But "programs" in this case means "giving the money to UNICEF" (as well it should, since that's its mandate). The 3.4% of administrative expenses listed does not include UNICEF's own administrative expenses. (However, <a href="http://www.unicef.org/emerg/disasterinasia/24615_faq.html">UNICEF's FAQ</a> says "you can choose to earmark your contribution for the tsunami relief effort...As each of UNICEFs Country Offices have their own annual budget to cover their overhead costs, your donation can go solely to the relief effort").
<p>
It pays to poke around. Look in the <a href="http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/cgi-bin/mt/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=151">comments</a> of this post for people's discussion of pros and cons of different charities, in addition to my own decisions. 
</font></td></tr></table></center>
<p>
<a href="http://www.networkforgood.org/topics/international/earthquake/tsunami122604.aspx?source=GOOG&cmpgn=EATSU">Network for Good</a>, also mentioned on the Google page, does not itself accept donations for tsunami relief, but rather provides further links to several different charities. 
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://pages.ebay.com/tsunamirelief/index.html">eBay's Tsunami Disaster Relief Page</a> allows you to sell things on eBay and automatically donate 10-100% of the proceeds to one of eight charities.
</p>
<p>If you are specifically interested in any others, let me know and I'll add them. I'm also interested in other feedback and reports on the charities, particularly if you have links (such as to news articles) that can document any problems that may be relevant. </p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.charitywatch.org/criteria.html">American Institute of Philanthropy's criteria</a>. Here is their page on the <A href="http://www.charitywatch.org/hottopics/tsunami_asia.html">most effective ways to help victims of the tsunami</a> (e.g. it's better to donate money than goods, beware of fly-by-night charities).
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/2/cpid/35.htm">Charity Navigator's criteria</a> ( or via the <a href="http://64.233.161.104/search?q=cache:qUSM08UOBY4J:www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/content.view/catid/2/cpid/35.htm+site:charitynavigator.org+how+do+we+rate&hl=en">Google cache</a>).</p>
<p>
The Tsunami blog also mentions various other funds which are local to India and SE Asia; I don't have any information on their efficiency or transparency. 
</p>

<p>Give wisely, generously, and soon.</p>

<hr/>

<p>Update: Now that many billions of dollars have been earmarked for tsunami relief and reconstruction, by governments, 
corporations, and private individuals, you may want to consider donating to these charities' general funds, 
rather than earmarking your donation for the tsunami. Though the tsunami is the worst natural disaster of recent 
times, killing more than 150,000 people, it is dwarfed by things like AIDS 
(which has killed <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_toll#Contractible_disease">19 million people</a> 
and is <A href="http://www.unaids.org/wad2004/EPIupdate2004_html_en/Epi04_05_en.htm#P64_10688">
destroying much of sub-Saharan Africa</a>) and the <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Congo_War">
war in the Congo</a> (which has killed <A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_toll#War_and_military_action">3.8 million 
people</a>, mainly from disease and starvation, since 1998).

<p>I'd really like to see efficiency information included along with the other criteria.  Perhaps also a 'tick-the-box' situation as to whether donations go towards proselytising too.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>JS: the BBB report on the Red Cross discusses in detail their handling of the 9/11 money. They are still sitting on some of it, but there may be good reasons for that. I haven't run across other discussions of that aspect, but I'm sure there are some out there.</p>

<p>Joe: Actually I looked at that, but the problem is that the United States Fund for UNICEF seems to be a "funnel" charity. They are efficient in terms of their major "project", which is grants to UNICEF. That doesn't, however, tell you what UNICEF does with the money, in terms of real projects vs. administrative/bureaucratic overhead, etc.</p>

<p>Jackson, that would be interesting; but I don't know where to get that information, and it's also hard to define "proselytizing". I'm a big fan of the <a href="http://www.gfusa.org">Grameen Foundation</a>, which is a secular charity and doesn't proselytize in a religious sense -- but they do promote particular social practices, even to the extent of, for instance, asking credit recipients to pledge not to engage in dowry marriage! Is that proselytizing?</p>

<p>So your best bet with regards to that issue is to go to the charity's website and poke around to see if their philosophy fits yours, and what they consider "programs".</p>

<p>Added World Vision, Mercy Corps, AFSC. The watchdogs I'm familiar with seem to have information on the American Red Cross rather than IFRC. However, now I'm wondering if ARC and IFRC have the same funnel/destination relationship as United States Fund for UNICEF and UNICEF, which might artificially inflate ARC's efficiency (i.e., some layers of bureaucracy are "hidden" by the transfer between ARC and IFRC). Anyone know anything about this?</p>

<p>Isn't the Red Cross and United Way constantly coming into little scandals because of how little of each dollar makes it to the victim in need? After 9/11 there was an investigation as to how the Red Cross squandered most the donations for the victims' fund.</p>

<p>How about trying to find out and publish how much of every dollar donated actually goes to the people in need (especially the children)?</p>

<p>lc, I added some links relating to the controversy around the American Red Cross's usage of 9/11 funds. There is a breakdown of disbursed money in the BBB report. From a cursory reading, it looks like they were sluggish and bureaucratic about disbursing the money, but most of it has been given out. It also seems like many people thought it was all going to victim's families, when in fact a lot of it went to infrastructural items like call centers. Infrastructure is important too, though.</p>

<p>There was also controversy around the fact that the ICRC <a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/ngos/credib/2004/0515pressure.htm">knew about the Abu Ghraib abuses</a> and complained in private to the US, rather than going public. "Red Cross workers insist that the policy of talking only to prison authorities about abuses they have witnessed is what opens the prison gates for them."</p>

<p>Big organizations like the Red Cross are to some extent magnets for this kind of complaint (complaining about the financial practices of, say, the National Association of Police Athletic Leagues is not going to make headlines), which is why the hard data collected by the watchdog organizations can be a useful corrective. </p>

<p>There was also a <a href="http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/africa/02/27/inquiry.children/">scandal</a> involving ongoing child abuse by local UNHCR and Save the Children employees that may have tangentially involved <a href="http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2002/5/6/151901.shtml">other NGOs</a>.</p>

<p>Ben,<br />
The only issue with the charity navigator is that it reports charities that receive more than $500,000 in public support with  require 4 years of Forms 990 to complete an evaluation.</p>

<p>Ours usually is under $50K (as 90% of our work is pro-bono) and as we are a small organization 0% is spent on admin. - I don't take a salary and cover admin. costs. We also work with partners who employ local labor and utilize construction techniques. </p>

<p>By working with those affected this keeps funds within the community and creates micro-economies for those trying to get out of this disaster. We have found this to be the most cost-effective way of rebuilding.</p>

<p>Back on topic I think Guidestar is more inclusive but there support sucks (online updating has been down for FOUR months and no-one returns calls).</p>

<p>Cheers for bringing this topic up - it is vitally important in relief work.</p>

<p>One last thought - any massive organization such as the Red Cross already has disaster supplies at hand and in stock, they don't run to the store the moment someone hands them a check. They also have emergency funds at hand for dispursement. Any money going to them is for future restocking, not to help someone tomorrow or next week.  IMHO, the smaller and mid-sized organizations are the ones I want give to, they logically should move faster and have less administration overhead (Red Cross spent $100 million out of the 9/11 $500 million on telecommunications, accounting and database management systems???!!!)  Apparently they have $2 billion in assets right now: http://google.com/search?q=cache:www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/3277.htm<br />

<p>lc, those are good points. Big organizations may be slow and inefficient. However, they may also have certain economies of scale -- administrative salaries and the like may actually be a smaller percentage of a big charity's total funds, if the same number of people are moving more money. It pays to examine the details.</p>

<p>Anonymous, when I go to  http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org , I get redirected to <a href="http://www.kintera.org/atf/cf/%7BA54B526F-06CB-4D53-8A37-C33976730CAB%7D/dwb.htm">this page</a>, which says "Doctors Without Borders web site is experiencing very heavy traffic".

<p>lc - while it's true that smaller organisations might move faster in some situations, I personally give regularly to organisations like MSF *because* they're larger.  The stocks of disaster supplies they have means that they're able to move very quickly to provide the resources that are needed - MSF is already moving the supplies in to establish a field hospital for thousands of people for a 3 month period.  Personally I don't mind donating money that could be spent on the restocking of these supplies, because I know it's going to help continue the work that's already been started.</p>

<p>Re: GiveWorld, there is no watchdog information available from Charity Navigator, AIP or BB. However, their parent organization's <a href="http://www.giveworld.org/files/give_2003_federal_returns.pdf">2003 Form 990</a> is online, which is an admirable degree of transparency. In 2003, GiveWorld started with $6,298.00 in assets, received $126,129.00 in revenues ($100K from one company), disbursed $4,445.00 in programs and spent $951.00 on management. </p>

<p>The good news: high transparency, lean administration, and a volunteer staff. The bad news: not much of a track record yet, perhaps?</p>

<p>However, looking deeper, I'm not sure if those numbers account for all donations <a href="http://www.giveworld.org/100commit.htm">made through GiveWorld</a> to their <a href="http://www.giveworld.org/projectselection.htm">partner NGOs</a>? Basically, the model seems to be that GiveWorld screens grassroots NGOs in India, publishes a <a href="http://www.giveworld.org/preed/pre_profile.htm">profile</a> on each, breaks down what each <a href="http://www.giveworld.org/preed/pre_donation_detail_don_id_335.htm">donation</a> will do, and requires the recipient NGOs to provide social-worker-case-report-like <a href="http://www.giveworld.org/Fb_GFUSA2008b.pdf">feedback</a> on the results. </p>

<p>So it seems like it's potentially a lean, innovative model with an emphasis on transparency and accountability. It's not clear how much GiveWorld has in the way of resources for oversight of the recipient NGOs.</p>

<p>It's not clear how old GiveWorld is. Is this a start-up?</p>

<p>Thanks Mike, added Americares.</p>

<p>I just donated to Asha for Education -- I'm impressed with their transparency, their efficiency, the flurry of on-the-ground activity on their <a href="http://ashatsunamirelief.blogspot.com/">blog</a>, their size (small enough to seem to me to be nimble, large enough to be stable as an enterprise), their usually long-term focus (and the speed at which they adapted to respond to this disaster), and their structure -- they seem to be principally composed of Indians, in America and Europe as well as in India, organized into small chapters which make donations directly to grassroots NGOs. </p>

<p>The fact that, in this case, many of the donors living in the first world share a language and culture with recipients in Third World poverty, strikes me as a very good example of leverage -- look at their <a href="https://www.ashanet.org/index.php?topic=internship&page=faq">internship FAQ</a> for an example of what I mean -- they take it for granted that interns will speak an Indian language and have a local friend or family member to stay with -- so it sounds like we're talking about a constant flow of donor Indians from the US and Europe dropping in on the recipient grassroots NGOs to help out while on summer break, family vacations, etc -- a wonderfully low-cost and reliable mechanism for oversight, it seems to me. </p>

<p>They also seem to be entirely volunteer-run -- according to their <a href="https://www.ashanet.org/library/reports/2003-incomestmt.pdf">income statement</a>, in 2003 they spent only $21K on general and administrative expenses, of which they account for about $14K explicitly in categories like banking fees, postage and printing, and advertising. I like the idea that none of my donation is going towards salaries or office rental, and that the money is nonetheless going straight to on-the-ground NGOs without any intermediaries. The only people getting paid here are Indian social workers and the like, and my dollar goes a lot farher in Indian social worker salaries than it would in paying American charity CEOs, etc.</p>

<p>I may make a donation to one of the larger charities as well, however. The one drawback of Asha is that India, while hard hit, seems to have relatively more resources to deal with the problems than places like Indonesia, which is devastated, and Myanmar, which is not letting anyone even know that there is a problem. So I'm interested in what are the most effective ways to reach those places.</p>

<p>The United States Fund for UNICEF "funnels" money to UNICEF becuase that is its mission.  UNICEF does not receive money from the UN, so there are 38 national committees that raise money and awareness about its causes.  You can research their efficiency by looking at their annual reports on their websites: unicef.org and unicefusa.org.<br />
Carol Bellamy has come under fire for her work at unicef, mostly from those who oppose her interest in increasing the opportunites for girls because they see this as some kind of hidden "women's rights" agenda.</p>

<p>Thanks for the information, clattun, John, John, lc, and mayes.</p>

<p>John, I don't know much about fostering orphans. There is reason to be cautious; the <a href="http://usgovinfo.about.com/od/consumerawareness/a/noadopt.htm">State Department has blocked adoptions</a>: "the international standard in a crisis is to keep children as close to their family members as possible. It can be extremely difficult to determine whether children whose parents are missing are truly orphans." </p>

<p><a href="http://www.unicef.org/emerg/disasterinasia/24615_faq.html">UNICEF also advises caution</a>: "In conflict and other emergency situations, UNICEF operates on the principle that no child should be adopted abroad unless it is firmly established that he or she has no parents, relatives or community members willing and able to care for the child."</p>

<p>Many affected areas lost disproportionately more children than adults -- there may be more parents who lost children in the tsunami, than children who lost parents. If local relatives can be provided with the resources to take care of the children, or local families can adopt them, those children may be much better off where they have a shared language, culture, religion, family, and where everyone around them has been through the same tragedy. </p>

<p>mayes, I did not mean to criticize United States Fund for UNICEF for channeling money to UNICEF -- obviously, that's their job. I wanted only to point out that comparing the expenses of different charities is not necessarily apples to apples: the Form 990 filed in the USA may not account for all the administrative expenses. </p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.unicef.org/emerg/disasterinasia/24615_faq.html">UNICEF FAQ</a>, however, does say the following: "When you make a donation to UNICEF, either on our website or by telephone (see above), you can choose to earmark your contribution for the tsunami relief effort or any other program. As each of UNICEFs Country Offices have their own annual budget to cover their overhead costs, your donation can go solely to the relief effort."</p>

<p>Do you have any links to articles defending Carol Bellamy's administration of UNICEF? I'd love to offer any detailed opposing view. <br />

<p>sifta, I have added IRW. Also added Sarvodaya, noted via the <a href="http://www.sfwa.org">Science Fiction Writers of America</a> newsletter.</p>

<p>Stop by www.gfa.org/tsunami.  This Christian organization keeps their administrative costs separate from designated donations.  So 100% of your gift goes to the disaster relief.  GFA was the first group on the site.</p>

<p>You forgot Catholic Relief Services, which on December 30 announced a commitment of $25 million for emergency relief and long-term rehabilitation programs to assist people affected by the Dec. 26 tsunami. The amount represents one of the earliest and largest such commitments to date for the tsunami relief efforts.  See www.catholicrelief.org</p>

<p>Added Catholic Relief Services, and a comment urging people to consider giving beyond just funds earmarked for the tsunami.</p>

<p>Since I mentioned giving to Asha, I should add that I also gave to Sarvodaya, for somewhat similar reasons: grassroots organization, local employees, involved in more than just disaster relief. I don't have much data on its efficiency, but in this case I'm swayed by my regard for Arthur C. Clarke -- surely this can be forgiven of a science fiction writer! :-)</p>
