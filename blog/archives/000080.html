<p>Thank God for Google -- check <A href="http://www.cyberdark.net/ver.php3?cod=9398">this</a> out! Looks like "Embracing the New" was translated into Spanish! (And I even made the cover in the Spanish version).</p>

<p>Donde puedo encuentrar una copia? Quiero leer mi cuento en Espanol!</p>

<p>That's just insanely cool.  Dang.</p>

<p>Yeah, I actually found the site and ordered a copy. They wrote back saying (if I understand the Spanish) that they don't usually send overseas, but for me they'd make an exception, and something about an illustration(!)</p>

<p>At Worldcon, Shelia Williams told me that the foreign editions not only translate the stories, they often *redraw* the illustrations -- a form of translation, I guess?<br />

<p>I think it might be an issue with contracts - it might be cheaper for foreign publishers to buy the rights to the text and buy their own art rather than to buy both. If they do "translate" the art, I wonder what the process involves.<br />

<p>I've got my copy, and it seems pretty neat. I don't really speak much Spanish, but I was able to read it quite easily, since, you know, I know what it says. </p>

<p>There's an illustration, which has nothing to do with the story other than maybe thematically (it's sort of a bunch of praying hands), but is pretty cool.</p>

<p>This is too cool. How long was the lag between the English and Spanish editions? (I'm going to have to get mine when it comes out.)</p>

<p>The story was in the January Asimov's in English; the Spanish version was in the September Asimovs Ciencia Ficcion.</p>

<p>They don't translate all the stories in English-language Asimov's -- the font is larger, I think, and Spanish is longer anyhow, and they add  at least one story a month from a native Spanish-speaking author, and they have their own editorials and letters to the editor and such. So it seems like they translate maybe half of the English-language stories.</p>
