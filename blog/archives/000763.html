  The Kind of Conversation We Have 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>We are on vacation in France. It has been a long, fun, challenging day. We are in mid-getting-ready-for-bed ritual when:</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Where is my toothbrush?</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Your electric toothbrush? It's at home. Here, Mommy bought these toothbrushes for you and Aviva for the trip. This one is yours.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> That's not my toothbrush.</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Well, it is now. </p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> (wailing) No! That is not the way it works! This is not the right toothbrush! I can't brush my teeth without the right toothbrush!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Oh come on! Just use this one!</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> (in anguish) Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> I take it you don't want to use that toothbrush.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Yes! I want my toothbrush! Get my toothbrush!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Your toothbrush is in Basel.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Aggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> How I wish that I could gather you up in my arms and we could fly you there through the night wind, over the storks sleeping on the chimneys, to fetch your toothbrush!</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Yeah!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> But I do not have this power.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Arrrrrrrrrrrrgggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh! No no no no no!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> I suppose you could just skip brushing your teeth tonight.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> But then I will get cavities and my teeth will get rotten and fall out!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> This is true. Well, not after one time of skipping brushing your teeth. Only if it becomes a habit.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! No! Get me my toothbrush or I'll kill you!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Noah, you know that I don't like threats like that.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Okay, get me my toothbrush or I will throw you into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Before_I_Kill_You,_Mr._Bond">a tank of sharks, blithely unaware that all shark tanks have enormous drains</a>!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> I cannot.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Agghhh! (collapses into sobs)</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> (with Noah in my lap) Well, I see that there is no solution.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Agggh!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> It is completely, logically impossible. Nothing can happen from now on.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> What?</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Well, let's look at this logically. There are only three possibilities. One is that we go to Basel, tonight, and get your toothbrush. Can we do that?</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> No!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Another would be not brushing your teeth. But that, as you note, would make them fall out, so you are unwilling to do that.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Right!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> And the third, purely theoretical, logical possibility would be brushing your teeth with a toothbrush which is not your toothbrush, such as this toothbrush right here. But that, too, is impossible.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> No it isn't!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Oh yes it is. We established that earlier.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> It's <i>possible</i>.</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> I don't think so.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> It is!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> Hmm. Well, since we disagree on this point, I guess the only way to find out is empirically.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> What does 'empirically' mean?</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> It means doing an experiment. </p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> Oh, OK.</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> So, we need to design an experimental protocol to test your hypothesis. Your hypothesis is that "Noah could brush his teeth with a different toothbrush." How do you propose to test this?</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> I could brush my teeth with <b>this</b> toothbrush!</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> I am extremely skeptical. But, if you insist.</p>

<p><b>Noah:</b> (brushes teeth)</p>

<p><b>Me:</b> My God! I never believed it possible! But science triumphs once again!</p>

<p>Noah -- it reminded me of the arguments Bugs Bunny has with Daffy Duck and Elmer Fudd!  I think your daddy is very clever, don't you?</p>

<p>(For the record, Karen, Noah was agreeing with you -- he laughed when he read your comment and said "I know why she's saying Bugs Bunny!")</p>
