<p>I was paraphrasing the Tao Te Ching for Aviva and Noah, and I told them this bit, roughly from chapter 33: <br />
<blockquote><br />
    Which is smarter: <br />
       knowing about other people <br />
       or knowing about yourself?<br />
</blockquote><br />
"Knowing about other people," said Aviva, as if this were obvious.<br />
<blockquote><br />
    Which is harder:<br />
       being in charge <br />
       or having will power?<br />
</blockquote><br />
"Hmm," said Aviva. "Being in charge."<br />
<blockquote><br />
     Which is better:<br />
        having a huge pile of things<br />
        or having exactly what you want?<br />
</blockquote><br />
"Having a huge pile of things," said Aviva.<br />
"Really?" I said, a little taken aback. "Why?"<br />
"Daddy," said Aviva <A HREF="../archives/2004_07.html#000058">chidingly</A>, "it's not good for people to have everything they want."</p>

<p>Not sure why - but this post reminded me of a discussion I had with Eli (almost 4 years old for those who don't know him) a few days ago. He wanted to know if it was a "Shabbat Day". I said no... and he got quite upset. He explained that he loved Shabbat and wanted it to be that day. I asked what he wanted to do (suspecting that it was all about having fresh Challah) - and he surprised me slightly with looking at me like I was crazy and saying that he wanted everything. I explained carefully that part of what made Shabbat special is that it only happens one day a week - but he didn't seem particularly satisfied. Just kept telling me "but mommy, I love Shabbat days".</p>

<p>He has also started composing his own prayers on friday nights. The first time he made me not listen ("it's private mommy") - but later that night he asked me if I wanted to learn his prayer. This was a prayer over his lemonade:<br />
"The sun loves the candle<br />
The candle loves the sun<br />
The sun lights the flags"<br />
(the flags = tibetan prayer flags that hang on our sliding glass door and through which the morning sun shines most days)<br />

<p>Funny, I would have answered precisely the opposite to how Aviva responded to each question.</p>

<p>But of course, the point is not to answer, but to ask the questions.</p>

<p>Kids are amazing.</p>
