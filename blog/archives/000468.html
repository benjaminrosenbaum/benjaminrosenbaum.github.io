<p>So <a href="../archives/2006_12.html#000431">that art project</a> that <a href="http://www.ethanham.com">Ethan Ham</a> and I did has shipped!</p>

<p>It's the first in a series of art objects produced by The Present Group, which says it's "like a mutual-fund that produces art instead of profits".</p>

<p>Ethan created a robot that trolled <a href="http://www.flickr.com">Flickr</a> looking for his face. In the process, it found a number of "faces" that we wouldn't call faces. I wrote a series of interconnected stories based on those images. </p>

<p>So, stories about faces that only a robot can see.</p>

<p>There's a signed, limited edition of eighty handmade book-boxy things that subscribers to The Present Group got (you can still get one as a back issue). I signed 'em. With this special archival pen. It was a weird feeling, since I'm used to art that you make as many as you can of, not art that you constrain to a specific number of instances.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thepresentgroup.com/">You can see what the book looks like here</a>. (Keep clicking on it and it will unfold itself).</p>

<p><a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/info/?p=14">And the text of the stories I wrote is online here.</a> (You have to click the little >> at the upper right to go to the next page).</p>

<p>The little green box with a line in it on each picture, shows where the robot found a face.</p>

<p>They also <a href="http://www.archive.org/details/Anthroptic">recorded me reading the stories</a>, <a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/info/?p=5">interviewed me and Ethan</a>, <a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/info/?p=6">comissioned a critical essay on the work</a>, <a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/info/?p=8">collected links to related works of art</a>, and <a href="http://thepresentgroup.com/info/?p=7">made sure the physical object will last for a century</a>.</p>

<p>The audio and the text are <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC'd</a>, so you can redistribute them freely (and remix the audio), noncommercially and with attribution.</p>

<p>These people go all out.</p>

<p>Hi there.</p>

<p><br />
I write a monthly department for In These Times magazine that focuses on unique art. I'd love to cover this project for our June issue. The article would be about 200 words, plus a picture. Please respond as soon as possible if you're interested. I can be reached via email at erin@inthesetimes.com.</p>

<p>Best;<br />

<p>wow...wow...WOW...what an amazing piece.  I love the photos, the text, the boxy book.  The whole thing is amazing and wonderful.</p>

<p>Have you ever heard of Negativland?  This reminds me a lot of a project they did a few years ago titled "Deathsentences of the Polished & Structurally Weak".  </p>

<p>Erin, great! See my reply in mail.</p>

<p>Melanie, I have heard of Negativland -- I vaguely remember listening to their music years ago, and wasn't there a famous case of them sampling a U2 album -- but I don't know that project. What was similar about it?</p>
