<li><a href="https://powells.com/biblio/1-9780756405465-0">Other Earths</a> is out, containing a bit of abstract bleak-whimsy by me, "Nine Alternate Alternate Histories", as well as more substantial efforts by others, therein many <a href="https://www.sfsignal.com/archives/2009/03/toc-other-earths-edited-by-nick-gevers-and-jay-lake/">very good things</a>: almost everything in there was good, really, and the Wilson, Goss, and Shepard stories were terrific. 

<p>(<a href="https://chrononaut.org/log">Moles</a> and I are trading contrib copies, so I'm also reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eclipse-New-Science-Fiction-Fantasy/dp/1597801364/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1241549656&sr=8-1">Eclipse Two</a>, which I'm not in, but also like a lot. <blockquote>(Note: I'm trying to link to  Powell's more because I am pissed off at Amazon for their <a href="https://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2009/04/12/amazon-fail/">gayfail</a>, but their <a href="https://powells.com/biblio/2-9781597801362-0">entry for Eclipse Two</a> is so mangled I'm not even sure they're talking about the same book; please, Powell's, get it together.)</blockquote>)</p>

<p><li> In addition to the <a href="../archives/2009_03.html#000724">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://www.feedbooks.com/book/3511">"True Names"</a> is now also a finalist for the <a href="https://www.locusmag.com/News/2009/04/2009-locus-award-finalists.html">Locus Award</a>. Wish I could go to Seattle!</p>

<p><li> I sold a story: "The Frog Comrade", to <a href="https://sfsite.com/fsf/">F&SF</a>. It's been a while since I've gotten one of those letters in the mailbox, concentrating as I have been on the novel, <i>Resilience</i>, and the occasional children's picture book script. It felt nostalgic, and good.</p>

<p><li>Will post Wiscon schedule soon; on the way back, though, I'm <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ben-at-mcnallyjackson">reading in New York City</a>:<br />

<p>Just fyi, my understanding of the Amazon fiasco is that it was caused by some French guy who didn't understand that his actions would have global consquences.  (Why he thought it was ok to tag French stuff that way is another question entirely.) If Amazon were in any way homophobic, I am sure I would hear about it pretty quick.  My source assures me that Amazon is still a-ok:)</p>
