<p>So, I have heard nothing officially, but <a href="https://slushmaster.livejournal.com/37883.html">I read in the blogosphere</a> that Ramin aka <A href="https://www.davidackert.com">David Ackert</a> and I may have sold another story <A href="../archives/2004_10.html#000101">from the corpse of the dead novel</a> to <a href="https://www.rofmagazine.com/">Realms</a>. Yay!  </p>

<p>"Hearing random things about yourself via a <a href="https://www.bloglines.com">Bloglines</a> view into an RSS <a href="https://www.googlealert.com/">Google Alert</a>" is the new email...</p>

<p><b>Also</b>, <A href="https://www.ethanham.com">Ethan Ham</a> and I are doing art! Because I am lazy I will crib his announcement:</p>

<blockquote>
<div style="border: 1px solid black; padding: 5px 5px 5px 5px">
Benjamin Rosenbaum and I are collaborating and a project that will be the first work issued by <a href="https://www.thepresentgroup.com/">The Present Group</a>. 

<p>I'm excited both to be working with Benjamin, who is an extremely talented writer. His works have appeared in Asimov's, F&SF, Harper's, McSweeney's, Strange Horizons, Infinite Matrix, and other fine venues. Ben's stories have been nominated for both the Hugo and Nebula awards and has been included in numerous "Best Of" lists and anthologies. One of my favorite of his stories is <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/2001/20010917/bellur.shtml">Bellur</a>, which can be read online.</p>

<p>The Present Group is a quarterly art subscription service.   Every year TPG subscribers receive four limited edition works from four different contemporary artists.  Each work is accompanied by information to help them gain insight into the piece, its creator, and recurring themes in the contemporary art world.</p>

<p>For those of you who are on my mailing list for some reason (please email me if you'd like to be removed from it), but don't know/remember who I am:<br />
<div style="padding:10px 10px 10px 10px"><br />
Ethan Ham is an artist living in New York. His work often uses new media (computers and/or the internet) as well as mechanical and sculptural elements. He is particularly interested in generative and emergent art. His recent projects include commissions from <a href="https://rhizome.org/">Rhizome.org </a>(the New Museum of Contemporary Art) and <a href="https://turbulence.org/">Turbulence.org</a>. Ethan is Assistant Professor of New Media at City College, CUNY.<br />
</div></p>

<p></div><br />
</blockquote> </p>

<p>(I want Ethan to put back up a links to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040610003647/https://www.ethanham.com/">his old stuff</a>, like the globe-made-of-toy-soldiers and the public art fountain modelling landmine shrapnel distribution...)</p>

<p><br />
Oh, and it appears The Present Group is also <a href="https://theredproject.com/calls/?p=1041">soliciting contributions from art historians</a>...<br />

<p>Incidentally, anyone interested in The Present Group, the subscription is $130 until the end of the year (after which it is $150). </p>

<p>Ben, I keep meaning to mention to you that I was at a cookie potluck last month where everyone was supposed to bring something to read aloud.  I brought "Other Cities" and it was extremely well received.  I read Bellur and had to keep making long pauses while waiting for the laughter to die down.  A couple of people wrote down the information so that they could get copies (and coincidentally, another person there already owned a copy).</p>
