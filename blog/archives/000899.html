<p>Yes, my dears, my little <a href="https://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/journal/2000_10_22.html">online journal</a> here has languished.</p>

<p>It's difficult keeping a little mom-and-pop shop like this open in a <a href="../archives/2010_01.html#000794">deserted wintry East Coast beach town</a>. Social media has its tentacles in everything, there is even a <a href="https://memegenerator.net/instance/10150204">facebook in your facebook</a>, much as an earlier era brought us <a href="https://www.theonion.com/articles/new-starbucks-opens-in-rest-room-of-existing-starb,560/">nested Starbuckses</a>, and so I am going to have to rig up some contraption to automatically post links to the entries here into Facebook, Twitter, G+, and hUBBUB, for it to be worthwhile to go on. Let me know if you feel like helping with this little software project, or have seen the right tool that I should be using (keeping in mind that this here blog is on my self-hacked variant of an ancient version of Movable Type, practically cuneiform at this point).</p>

<p>But I have some plans brewing, worry not. First, I'm going to post the old crap that's hung around in my Drafts folder, even if it's not perfectly relevant to the moment, because as we know <a href="../archives/2009_09.html#000771">I tend to overthink this blogging thing</a>. And then I am going to post a series of letters home, written by my ancestor Thomas Covert, each one exactly 150 years after it was originally mailed. And I have another plot or two.</p>

<p>Watch this space!</p>

<p>Wow, that looks like it could be just the ticket, though apparently it doesn't have any way to access G+ yet...</p>

<p>I use "if this then that" for some of my automatic updates, as it can take rss as input.</p>

<p>And by mistake my email address has become visible above. Could you delete that first comment or something?</p>

<p>For what it's worth, your RSS feed works perfectly fine, and that's how I've been following you.</p>

<p>I've been doing a lot of blogging <i>in my mind</i>. I am despairing of doing, really, anything at all until the kids are old enough to go to sleepovers.</p>
