  Crunchy Free Metafiction In Nine Crunchy Formats!

<p>All ten of the stories I've licensed to them are now up at <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/BenjaminRosenbaumeBooks.htm">my page on Fictionwise</a>. Two of them, <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29647.htm">"Embracing-the-New"</a> and <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook30229.htm">"Biographical Notes to 'A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-planes' by Benjamin Rosenbaum"</a>, are free on Fictionwise on account of the whole award thing. So if you want to go there and grab them for your Mobipocket or Franklin or Palm thingies or what have you, go for it. You can even rate them, so I'll have more ego-stats to obsessively check. I also get five cents when you download them. Ka-ching!</p>

<p>Of course, you can also get them <a href="http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/stories/embracing.the.new.html">here </a>and <a href="http://www.allstarstories.com/rosenbaum-notes.html">here</a>, respectively.</p>

<p>There's also some stuff up that I haven't yet otherwise released to the web -- <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29941.htm">"The City of Peace"</a> for 42 cents, <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29942.htm">"The Valley of Giants"</a> and <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29790.htm">"Red Leather Tassels"</a> for 49 cents each,  <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29789.htm">"Droplet"</a> for 79 cents,  and <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29648.htm">"The Ant King: A California Fairy Tale"</a> for a whopping 85 cents. I'll probably put these up for free and Creative Commons them sooner or later, but I'm holding off for now; partly I'm interested in empirical data on that whole "does giving things away help or hurt sales?" question. </p>

<p>And if you are a true glutton/obsessive/PDA-cyborg/completionist, you can buy <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook30106.htm">"Start the Clock"</a> for 75 cents instead of reading it for free <a href="http://www.benjaminrosenbaum.com/stories/start.the.clock.html">here</a>, shell out 49 cents for <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook30107.htm">"The Death Trap of Dr. Nefario"</a> instead of <a href="http://www.infinitematrix.net/stories/shorts/dr_nefario.html">reading it for free at Infinite Matrix</a>, or give Fictionwise the 49 cents for <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook29649.htm">"The Book of Jashar"</a> that you really should probably be donating to the <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/fund_drives/200503/main.shtml">Strange Horizons fundraising drive </a>since they <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2003/20030317/jashar.shtml">published it first for free</a>. (And by the same logic you might want to donate to <A href="http://www.infinitematrix.net/">Infinite Matrix</a>, too).</p>

<p>Go crazy. :-)</p>

<p>(For writers interested in the economic side of this, the first batch of stories went up on 3/7, and Fictionwise owes me $118.79 in royalties so far -- $96.66 of which is due to the 2397 people who have downloaded "Embracing-the-New" for free. Next most popular is "Droplet" with 33 downloads -- maybe because of the phrase "Lovergirls, built long ago for pleasure and servitude" in the description?)</p>

<p>So every time I pay nothing for "Embracing-the-New", Fictionwise owes you four cents?</p>

<p>Hmm, I thought it was five cents, but it looks like four. I'm not sure it's every time, but certainly the first time. </p>

<p>As of today, 1011 people have downloaded "Biographical Notes..." and 2505 have downloaded "Embracing-the-New". The next runner up is "Droplet" with 34 downloads. That disconnect between free stuff and stuff that costs a smidgen is the internet in a nutshell, right there.</p>

<p>Wow. I have to admit, that's about 100x what I would have expected, and about twice as many downloads of "Biographical Notes" as we've had off allstarstories.com. (I don't have very good stats, so I can't say for sure.)</p>

<p>For comparison, my web server stats show 2636 page views for "Embracing-the-New" since I posted it on 12/21/04. Of course, it got BoingBoinged....</p>
