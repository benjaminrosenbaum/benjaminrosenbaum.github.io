<blockquote class="covert">
Camp Dennison, Jan. 24th, 1862

<p>It is with pleasure that I now take this opportunity to write you a few lines in answer to your kind letter which I received yesterday. I was very glad to hear that you were all well. I am well and getting along well. The sun is shining and it is quite warm here today. I believe it is the first pleasant day we have had since we have been here, if not it is so long since we have had one that I have forgot it. I never found those cookies till yesterday that you put in my satchel. I was looking for Edies likeness, you forgot to put that in. I wish you would send it by Jim if you get this before he leaves and if not send it by Blood. As for our being disbanded, we know nothing about it yet. The Colonial has got back from Columbus but said he could not tell any thing more about it than he could before he went. I should wonder if we were armed and put in the field after awhile. Nothing more at present.</p>

<p>I remain as ever,</p>

<p>T. M. Covert.</p>

<p>PS:<br />
I had not time to write more or I would. I have to go and drill.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Those are some pretty old cookies, right?</p>

<p>Do you think the likeness is a photograph? A drawing? A painted portrait (in a frame)?</p>

<p>Covert often makes some kind of distinction between "being well" and "getting along well". Perhaps one refers to physical health, the other to mood and psychology?<br />

<p>I think Mr.Covert is writing about a picture when said "likeness" but who knows for sure? a portrait in a frame would be too difficult to handle there.<br />
  A wonderfull letter anyway!</p>
