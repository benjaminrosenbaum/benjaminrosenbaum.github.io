  Aviva's Song for Noah 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>The other day, <A href="../images/may2004/Aviva2.jpg">Aviva</a> started spontaneously singing this song (of her own invention) to <a href="../images/may2004/Noah2.jpg">Noah</a> in the supermarket. Esther wrote it down, and I have translated it into English here:</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Always, always, always I want to live with you<br />
you are my brother for always<br />
I love you so much</p>

<p>You are so nice<br />
Do you want, when I'm seven,<br />
to go to school or kindergarten next door to each other?</p>

<p>I always pick you up<br />
when you fall in the water with your clothes on<br />
I pull you out</p>

<p>What do you want?<br />
Always, always I love you<br />
Always, always I love you<br />
I'm always your sister<br />
I am your heart<br />
I am your heart</p>

<p>When I'm ten and you're seven<br />
then we'll go in a restaurant<br />
without Mommy and without Daddy<br />
then we'll be so big<br />
as big as our Mommies</p>

<p>What do you want?<br />
What do you want?</p>

<p>Oh, I love you so much<br />
that I always want to go where you go<br />
where you go<br />
where you go</p>

<p><hr /></p>

<p>Ain't she?!</p>

<p>She does harass him a lot, when she's not singing his praises. He used to just gaze at her adoringly as she licked his nose, stuck fingers in his ears, did experiments in Newtonian mechanics using him as the falling weight, etc. </p>

<p>Now he's getting more assertive... he has this karate-like blocking move where he flings his arms over his head and then sweeps them down to his sides with great emphasis, while yelling, "Na!"</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>The love and the harassment are all part of the package (as I can say definitively, having two younger brothers--in one case, with that same 3-year age difference). The best thing is, the harassment eventually ends (leaving only minor trauma scars) whereas the fierce love and protectiveness stay forever. I know both my younger brothers are now taller (and physically stronger) than I am, but that means nothing. I'm still in charge of protecting them from anybody/everything, and I'm sure Aviva will be the same! </p>

<p>And what a cool song. :)</p>
