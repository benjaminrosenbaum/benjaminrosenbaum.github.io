  Noah: When I was a man, I crashed a lot of cars.<br />
  <br />
  Ben: But now you <a href="http://edit.mp3lyrics.org/s/sinead-oconnor/feel-so-different/">feel so different</a>?<br />
  <br />
  Noah: Yeah, when I die, I feel so different!<br />
</li></p>

<p><li><br />
  Noah: At <a href="http://www.templemicah.org/worship/totshabbat">Tot Shabbat</a> there's a little old woman and she's called God.</p>

<p>  Ben: (laughs) Noah, can I write in my blog that you said 'At Tot Shabbat there's a scary old woman and she's called God'?</p>

<p>  Noah: She's not scary!<br />
</li></p>

<p><li><br />
  Noah: Is God <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berakhah">King of the Universe</a>?</p>

<p>  Ben: Yes...</p>

<p>  Noah: OK.</p>

<p>  Ben: Or Queen of the Universe, I guess...</p>

<p>  Noah: God is Princess of the Universe!</p>

<p>1) What the heck is he talking about, and what does this have to do with theology?</p>

<p>2) I love the fact that there's something called Tot Shabbat. Also nice that you request permission before practicing poetic revisionism.</p>

<p>3) I wonder how the Universe decides on its royalty... </p>

<p>In the SCA(or at least Atlantia), kings are people who are really good at hitting other people with sticks. Princes are the heirs (they won Crown Tourney, but haven't been coronated). Dukes are people who have been king twice, but aren't currently. The female equivalent (queen, princess, duchess) are generally the consort of someone who hits people with sticks really well. </p>

<p>I like the idea that God's boyfriend beat up another god with a big stick, and now God's waiting to take office for a six month term. Well done, Noah!</p>

<p>peace<br />Matt</p>

<p>Incidentally, re #1: I don't know the Sinead O'Connor song, and I can't listen to it right now. Anyway, just curious.</p>

1) What do you mean? He means that previously, he was a man, and crashed a lot of cars. Since he is now a boy, and since crashing cars is bad for your health, we presume that some sort of transformation has occurred, possibly involving death. I asked the obvious question, which is, is this like in the Sinead O'Connor album where she feels so different and then the girl dies from ammonia because they were in the storm and then the boy is sad? Noah confirmed this.</p>

<p>Eschatology is a branch of theology. Sometimes. Anyway it's related.</p>

<p>2) You should come sometime. It's a blast. The parade with the stuffed Torah cushions is probably the best part.</p>

<p>3) Don't girls get to hit people with sticks? Also, if the king is gay, is his boyfriend still queen? (he asked with a straight face).</p>

<p>1) Wow.</p>

<p>2) Sounds like a hoot :)</p>

<p>3) Girls are allowed, and even encouraged, to hit people with sticks. There has, however, never been a female monarch by right-of-arms in this kingdom. I believe there have been in other SCAdian kingdoms. Some of the other kingdoms feel that Atlantia is kind of backwards for reasons along these lines. I don't believe there are any female knights by-right-of-arms, either, although there are female knight-level peers. Dame Anne, former seneschale of the kingdom springs to mind, although I don't know what she was knighted for.</p>

<p>I would imagine that given the SCA's propensity for terrible puns, yes, the boyfriend of the king would be queen. Again, that's never happened in Atlantia. Maybe other kingdoms.</p>

<p>There is a gay group in Atlantia, at least, called something like the Blue Feather society. I learned this when considering writing a filk about one of the local fighters to the tune of Copa Cabana. He didn't want to have anything to do with "feathers in his hair."</p>

<p>peace<br />Matt</p>

<p>1. Well, death seems to have that effect on some people.</p>

<p>2.  Does this little old woman look anything like whoopie goldberg, by any chance?  She looks about like i'd like to think god looks, although i suppose she'd have to get a bit older to qualify as old.  (Funny how these things seem to be relative.)</p>

<p>3.  The line between SCA and S&M seems to be finer than I had previously thought.  What fun.</p>

<p>(back to number two, do people get to hit each other with the torah cusions, like a big pillow fight, or am i confusing this with number three?)</p>

<p>1. Yes </p>

<p>2. No</p>

<p>3. This would be a new innovation, but I will suggest it to the kids, and I expect it will be tried out at the earliest opportunity</p>

<p>Um, I meant hitting people with the stuffed Torahs would be tried out as soon as possible.</p>

<p>In case that was unclear.</p>

<p>Re: Tot Shabbat and children hitting each other with The Plush Law--isn't there a scene like that in Pilgrim's Progress?</p>

<p>A couple of years ago at a Tot Seder, there was a bit of a plague fight with the Plush Plagues. I don't think there was a little old woman called Gd, though, at least not more than anywhere else.</p>
