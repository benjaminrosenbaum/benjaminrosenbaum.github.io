<p>I'm glad you made a friend. That's great! Making friends in school is one of the best parts. I'm sorry you didn't have fun the other day. Sometimes you won't, and sometimes you will. Good luck!</p>

<p>PS You rock!</p>

<p>Hi Aviva!  Congratulations on your first week of kindergarten.  I am glad you are making friends and having fun now.  </p>

<p>New things are sometimes scary and sometimes not.  Remember when you came to our house and met Molly and Luke our dogs?  They were scary at first but when you left they were not so scary.  But I don't think you were a bit scared of Caeleb and Abbie from the beginning, even though they were new to you.  :-)</p>

<p>Abbie started kindergarten this year too.  She is loving having schoolwork to do.  We are all learning so much!  This week Caeleb is making pictures of all the planets.  Jupiter is sooooo BIG!  </p>

<p>We all miss you and Noah and your mom and dad, and hope you can come and visit again SOON!</p>

<p>Lots of love,<br />
Patti</p>

<p>Friends are definitely one of the better perks at school.  It's pretty much the #1 reason I'm glad to be back at it!</p>

<p>Dear Aviva,</p>

<p>I am glad you made a friend at school. I also wanted you to know that Eli likes school better this week than he did last week.</p>

<p>Hurrah for school getting better all the time.<br />

<p>Dear Aviva,<br />
How wonderful to be starting kindergarten.  Brooks wishes he could start kindergarten, but he is at preschool instead.  He likes preschool an awful lot.  He plays "zappy guy" and sometimes "rocket launcher guy."  Remember how he likes super heroes?  We will be around in December and hope to see you then.</p>

<p>Hmm. My last message didn't post for some reason. I'll try again:</p>

<p>Dear Aviva:<br />
I am sorry to say that I HATED kindergarten. I am glad you are not having the same experience.</p>

<p>I hope you continue to make new friends!</p>
