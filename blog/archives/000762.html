<p>Oh, I've got two copies right here, I'll send you one.</p>

<p>...No, sorry, I don't.  But wouldn't that be neat?<br />

<p>The UC Berkeley copy is signed; does that help? Also there's one at GWU, one at Northwestern, UMCP, UPenn, the National Library of Israel, and NYPL and Harvard (of course), but you probably can't get to those, and at Oxford, too.</p>

<p>I'm assuming your are looking for 'Avi'; it looks as if exceprts (maybe) were published in English as 'A Dream Come True' (George Mandel, ed. Westview Press 1993), which is available used in the usual ways. I can't tell if this later one is actually what you are looking for, but it's worth a shot...</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>I knew his granddaughter when we were both counselors at Camp Tel Noar in New Hampshire.  That doesn't help and is not to the point, but I thought I'd say it anyway.</p>

<p>It's pretty cool though! What was she like?</p>

<p>I am just intrigued by the weirdness of being raised entirely in a language your father is bent upon resurrecting (and is in some sense creating from scratch), and becoming known for an autobiography about it. I might write something about it.</p>

<p>By chance I was just searching the web to see if I could locate a copy of Itamar Ben-Avi's autobiography and came across your website and post, Benjamin. (I came across a reference to it in Jack Fellman's book on the history of modern Hebrew). So ... I was wondering if maybe you had managed to track down a source in the meantime - would be great if you had. Thanks for any information, Hilary </p>

<p>No luck so far, Hilary, other than what V says above (I haven't followed it up)</p>
