  A Syllogism

<ol><li>So we were playing a lot of <a href="http://www.popcap.com/extras/pvz/">Plants vs Zombies</a> for a while there. Not just <i>playing</i>: I mean, a surprising percentage of my conversations with Noah,  for a couple of months, hinged on Plants and Zombies. While he brushed his teeth, I would have to recite dozens of zombies, and/or plants, in the order in which they appear. Backwards. Or by toughness, or cost. With, naturally, many hints and corrections from him.

<p>At one point we went away to a cabin in the Black Forest with no internet access for a week. Noah played Plants vs Zombies anyway, with two decks of cards -- Uno for plants, I believe, and poker cards for zombies. The Uno card "3" was the cherry bomb, you see, because, of course, the cherry bomb is the third plant. And so on.</p>

<p>Anyway, so when you beat Plants vs Zombies, as Aviva and Noah and I finally did, you get to see a music video, "Zombies on Your Lawn". The music, and sound in general, is one of the really amazingly well done things about that game.</p>

<p>There is this <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=98v7Jq6IFrE">excellent LARPish lipsynched version of the song</a>.</p>

<p><li>Zombies are of course all the rage (ha) nowadays. I finally broke down and wrote a zombie story recently (it's making the rounds). And <a href="http://justinelarbalestier.com/">Justine Larbalestier</a> and <a href="http://www.blackholly.com/">Holly Black</a> mocked/claimed/elaborated/pwned this trend beautifully in their recent anthology <a href="http://pages.simonandschuster.com/zombiesvsunicorns">Zombies vs. Unicorns</a> (which I don't have yet, but I did stumble upon <a href="http://www.alayadawnjohnson.com/">Alaya Dawn Johnson</a>'s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mc-l3xWXnOM">"Love Will Tear Us Apart"</a>, and it was really good!)</p>

<p><li>We have now pretty much stopped playing PvZ. For his birthday, Noah got a guitar. Aviva decreed that we need to have a family band -- you know, like the Partridge Family? And so we are all assigned instruments. I was assigned the drums. So far my drums are two chopsticks and a cardboard box. </p>

<p>But: while we got Noah a guitar, and some guitar books, we didn't get him any lessons yet, because there's a spot in the great local music school only in summer. </p>

<p>So Noah insisted that I work through the guitar book with him. And because, unlike me, Noah is patient and diligent and dogged, a side effect of this was that I accidentally started to learn, sort of, how to play the guitar.</p>

<p><li>So let's see if we can do the math here:</p>

<p>Awesome! Can you please post the chords to this song? I would like to learn it to play on my guitar.</p>

<p>I don't really understand chords. It's all in E, with an E flat 10 and an E minor 6 suspended or something? Is what someone told me? Anyway here it is in a geeky notation. </p>

<p>In this notation, for instance, an E chord is 022100 - each number represents the fret on which the string is played, with strings in order from lowest to highest (EADGBe). An arrow (3->0) means you are plucking at fret 3, then lifting your finger so that the note reverts to 0. [5t] means strum five times. Get it?</p>

<pre>
Chorus:
(3->0)xxxxx Unicorns
022100 [5t]
(3->0)xxxxx Unicorns
022100 [3t] on the lawn
(3->0)xxxxx Unicorns
022103 [4t]
02210(3->0) Don't want
(3->0)xxxxx unicorns
022100 [3t] on my lawn
            When I   
022012 [5t] count to ten baby
 [rest 2]   Those
x(3->2)xxxx Unicorns
(3->0)xxxxx better be
022100      gone.
            Their 
xxx103 [4t] skin is soft as
xxx130 [4t] velvet. Their manes 
xxx120 [4t] ripple in the 
xxx100      wind.
            They are 
xxx103 [4t] trampling on the 
xxx130 [4t] tulips that are
xxx120 [4t] starting to come
xxx100      in.
            I am 
xxx103 [4t] getting such a 
xxx130 [4t] headache from the
xxx120 [4t] rainbows every
xxx100      -where.
            They are 
xxx103 [4t] swimming in the 
xxx130 [4t] swimming pool
xxx120 [4t] and clogging up the filters with their
033200      U-
055300      ni-
077500      corn
022100      hair.
<b>Repeat chorus.</b>
</pre>
I think that's it. I'm not entirely sure about the frets for "Unicorn hair", but it's something along those lines.

<p>Hmmm, that's very confusing. You will have to show me in July. Please note that you have inspired Gideon's songwriting and he has featured your song on his blog! </p>
