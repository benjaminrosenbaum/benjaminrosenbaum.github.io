  Carbon footprint

<p>Okay, so <a href="https://www.bp.com/extendedsectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9006010&contentId=7012265">this</a> is essentially an ad for buying BP's "green energy", and I have no idea about how green their energy really is. And the level of granularity doesn't (it surely matters how <i>big</i> your house is?)</p>

<p>Nonetheless, it's a pretty cool Java applet, and may motivate you to insulate your doors and windows. Who knows? We could make it a meme: post your carbon score...</p>

<p><center><table border=2 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=5 ><tr><td><br />
<h3>My CO<sub>2</sub> footprint is: 19 tons</h3><br />
<a href="https://www.bp.com/extendedsectiongenericarticle.do?categoryId=9006010&contentId=7012265">What's yours?</a><br />
</td></tr></table></center></p>

<p>Eh? meme? Anyone?</p>

<p>Nineteen tons apparently is just exactly the US average. Startlingly, given how often I congratulate myself on all that riding on the Metro.</p>

<p>We have one car that we don't drive that much, and turn off lights and all that; but it's those long-haul flights to Switzerland that get us.<br />

<p>unfortunately, swiss people can't participate :-(</p>

<p>so here's the swiss/non-BP variant: <a href="https://www.footprint.ch">www.footprint.ch</a></p>

<p>if everyone acted like me, we'd need 1.7 planets to cover all energy needs (average: swiss 2.6, american 5.8)</p>

<p>hmmmm....</p>

<p>Ho HO!</p>

<p>11 tons! In your FACE, Rosenbaum!</p>

<p>We actually spent a lot of time and money weatherproofing our house this year, tho. Also, between our 4-cylinder SUV and our 35 MPG Focus, we're doing pretty well in the mileage department. Although that said, if there were a place for miles driven/day, I'm sure my carbon score would have been higher.</p>

<p>Oops. There WAS a place for miles...</p>

<p>25 tons... I suck...</p>

<p>I'm officially out of your face, Ben.</p>

<p>15 tonnes... it's nice to be able to walk to work. One of my mental blocks towards moving to somewhere less expensive (which is pretty much anywhere besides NYC, I guess) is that I know I'd have to give that up.</p>

<p>Hmm, I got 2.6 Earths on the Swiss quiz.</p>

<p>So I'm average for the US on one quiz, less than half that on the other -- which gives some sense of the margin of error. :-(</p>

<p>12 tons here... I live by myself in a detached, so using 100% renewable electricity is my one saving grace. (My electricity program also builds salmon ladders, but no credit for that in this quiz).     </p>

<p>I took the quiz twice: once for two people in the house, once for just myself, but with the same values plugged in. It gave me the same number both times (22 tons) -- so I think multiple-person households get to split their outputs. Which means I get to claim 11 tons for myself, and you get to claim, what, 5 tons?</p>

<p>Damn, now I'm going to be late getting back to work because I just *had* to know my C02 output....</p>

<p>I got 13 tons, but there was a lot of vagueness/approximation in my answers.  An Australian <a href="https://www.carbonneutral.com.au/default.aspx">Carbon Neutral Calculator</a> puts me at more like 25, but I think I misunderstood their air-travel system.</p>

<p>I've been trying to learn more about carbon offsets; something about the idea bugs me, but I haven't quite been able to articulate what.  Do you know much about it?</p>

<p>10 tonnes here, which apparently is greater than the UK average of 10 tonnes. Hm.</p>
