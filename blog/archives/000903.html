Camp Hutchins, Dec. 3rd, 1861

<p>My Dear Wife:</p>

<p>It is with pleasure that I sit down to let you know that I received your letter last night. I was glad to hear that you was all well, but sorry that you do not get along any better. I shall try to have a part of my wages paid to you monthly. The Captain has promised me the Saddlers place & if I get it, it will be a good thing for me & I hope that I shall get it. We have got our overcoats & boots & will have the rest of our cloths today & tomorrow. I can't come home till after then, but do not look for me till I come, for I don't know when they will send me. I do not feel verry well to day, but I hope that I shall feel better by tomorrow. I was on gard Sunday and cought cold & have a hard pain in my right lung, but I think I shall be well in a day or two. Tell Edie that I take her picture and look at it every day, and that I will come as soon as I can. I send you in this letter one dollar. It is all I have to send. You must excuse me for not writing more as I do not feel very well. </p>

<p>Yours As Ever,</p>

<p>T. M. Covert.<br />
</blockquote></p>

<p>Dictated by Aviva to me on a Saturday morning in Basel, one hundred and fifty years, to the day, after <a href="../archives/2011_11.html">Thomas Covert</a> sent it. </p>

<p>Edie was his daughter. The themes in this letter -- homesickness, health problems, struggles to support the family financially while off at war -- will recur.</p>

<p>Why was Aviva dictating this to you?</p>

<p>You should post photos of Thomas Covert, his wife Katie, and their daughter Edith.</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>Aviva was dictating because I really wanted to post it 150 years to the day after he sent it, and I had the kids all day, and if I'd been trying to barricade myself off alone to do it they would have been sure to find a strategem to get me back out again. This way everyone was involved! :-)</p>

<p>There are some photos in the book you made... do you have electronic copies of them, or do I need to re-scan?</p>
