<p>Seventh in a <a href="http://benjaminrosenbaum.com/blog/archives/cat_history.html">series</a> of letters my great-great-great-grandfather wrote home from the American Civil War, exactly 150 years ago. </p>

<p>The first part was written on the 4th, but it was sent on the 5th.</p>

<blockquote class="covert">
Camp Dennison, Feb. 4th, 1862

<p>My Dear Wife:</p>

<p>I now take this opportunity to write a few lines to let you know that I am well and hope these few lines will find you the same. Theres little or no news to tell you about. Our camp Capt. Myer had a little fuss in his Company yesterday, they went to Millford, a little town that is about a mile from here for the purpose of attending church but instead of that got drunk and came home and got into a fight amongst themselves so there officers put them in the gard house and there was one of Capt. Bartletts Corporals did something that he got put in the gard house for and today he was reduced to the ranks. It was at Dress Parade, so you see it was done before all the Companies. I was on Brigade Gard last night. We had four prisoners in the gard house to gard. One of them has been in about six weeks. He was put in for striking a Colonial of one of the Regements that is here in camp. I was mistaken about that Corporal being put in the gard house. He was not put in the gard house but reduced to the ranks, Feb. 4th. Well I suppose we are disbanded and will be at home or part of the Company will in the course of a month. All I know about it is this. The Captains of all the Companies told there men that the Assistant Agt. General fetched a dispatch to our Colonial & the Colonial was not at home & he told the Major that we were probably disbanded, so the Captain told the men of it and wanted them to think of it and make up in their minds how many of them wanted to go as Infantry. I dont know whether I shall come home or not, nor if we are disbanded I may go to work some place about here but I dont know yet what I shall do.</p>

<p>Charles Pinkins has been worse since I wrote to you. There is ten chances for him to die where there is one for him to get well. Horace Drew & Nathen Basset are taking care of him. Jim & I have got at work. I went down to Cincinnati to get leather but did not have much of a chance to see the place. I started from here at half past twelve P.M. and got back at Four O'clock. Nothing more at present.</p>

<p>Yours As Ever</p>

<p>T. M. Covert.</p>

<p>Six O'clock Wednesday Morning, Feb. 5.<br />
Charles Pinkins is dead, he died at Four O'clock this morning. The Capt. is agoing to send his body home. His death casts a gloom over all the Regement. He is the first man that has died in the Regement. But if we were kept here till next May there would be plenty more that would die. Charles has had the best of care. We have one of the best Doctors that can be found and some of the best nurses.</p>
