  <div class="what"> </div> 
</div> 
<blockquote>I was Oberon in high school. I think I'm playing Theseus and Lysander this time. I'm in it for the whole three hours, with my reading directly afterwards... it's either in retrospect going to seem like a really dumb idea to have signed up for so many hours of unremitting performance, or be one of those non-traditional format con highlights like "Let's Build A World" at Wiscon.</blockquote>

<div class="title">Imagining Anarchy</div> 
<div class="time">1:00 pm, ME/ CT</div> 
<div class="what">Ursula K. Le Guin did it in <i>The Dispossessed</i>; Cecelia Holland in <i>Floating Worlds</i>; Kim Stanley Robinson in <i>Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars</i>. What other depictions of anarchist societies can we find in speculative fiction? How does the setting (and the resources available) influence and shape the politics? Different readers have viewed Le Guin's Annares as utopian or dystopian; is that the rule for portrayals of anarchism, and what does that tell us about anarchism as a form of government?

<div class="title">The 9,191,935,961 Names of God: Metaphysical Hard SF. </div> 
<div class="time">10:00 am, Salon G</div> 
<div class="what">The climactic speculations in Olaf Stapledon's <i>Starmaker</i> have the rigor we ordinarily associate with hard sf, but it is unlikely that science could ever verify the speculations, which are fundamentally metaphysical. What other sf has speculated as rigorously about things final and unknowable? And where does sf based on unverifiable ideas in contemporary physics (like the multiverse and the anthropomorphic principle) fit? Do we distinguish between unverifiable ideas depending on whether they have a spiritual component or implication?

<div class="title">It Is, It Is, It Really Is Fiction: Gender and Sexuality in Contemporary F&SF.  </div> 
<div class="time"> 2 pm, Salon F</div> 
<div class="what">Over forty years have passed since words like "frelk" and "kemmer" became part of the literature, and nearly twenty since the establishment of the Tiptree Awards -- if we have not reached the gender-fluid futures of Tanith Lee's <i>Don't Bite the Sun</i> or Theodore Sturgeon's <i>Venus Plus X</i>, where are the contemporary explorations of sexuality that is genuinely <i>other</i>? As it is inconceivable that there is an upper limit to the polymorphously perverse (and indeed, the internet disproves this theory on a regular basis) and on the understanding that one reader's speculative fiction may be another's day-to-day routine, we ask our panelists to consider the sexual state of the field, whether it be Simon Logan's fetishcore fiction, the transformative erotica of Caitlin R. Kiernan, or the distinct possibility that the appeal of the modern vampire is merely necrophilia with better conversation.

<p>just wondering- do you sleep or breathe or any of those things?  whenever I look at your blog, it's like one of those vaudeville comedies and you're being pulled off by some enormous shepherd's crook to another destination offstage.</p>

<p>Anyway, though I wasn't there, and though the wiscon thingy has, I take it, come and gone, I rather liked your  bizarre version of Sense and Sensibility and think it would be fun to have it read aloud...</p>

<p>have a good sommer, try not to bake...</p>

<p>I averaged about 5 hours of sleep a night during a con, which is pretty typical for a con. I'm totally zonked afterwards. Between cons I do sleep and breathe.</p>

<p>S&S is great fun to read aloud -- too long to read all of it though. In the event I read some quick, standard Other Cities and then some work-in-progress short stories. Reading them was useful in figuring out what to do next with them.</p>

<p>Good summer to you too!</p>
