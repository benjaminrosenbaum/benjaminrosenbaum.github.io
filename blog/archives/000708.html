  The Week of Cakes 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>For fifty-one weeks of the year, we bake no cakes.</p>

<p>Then comes Aviva and Noah's birthdays. They are one day apart. So we have:<br />
<ul><li>cake for family party on Aviva's actual birthday<br />
<li>cake for Aviva to take to school<br />
<li>cake for family party on Noah's actual birthday<br />
<li>cake for Noah to take to school<br />
<li>cake(s) for Aviva's kids' party on weekend (8 invited kids this year, possible parents and siblings in tow )<br />
<li>cake(s) for Noah's kids' party on weekend (5 invited kids this year, possible parents and siblings in tow )<br />
<li>possible cake for adult party on weekend evening <ul><li>or maybe they'll just have the leftovers</ul><br />
</ul></p>

<p>Conversation with Noah this morning:</p>

<p><b>Me</b>: So do you like fluffy light cakes or rich thick cakes? Like Angel's food cake or like brownies?</p>

<p><b>Noah</b>: Rich thick cakes!<br />
(calling from room after I have left) No! Wait! Angel's food cake!</p>

<p><b>Me</b> (returning): Why did you change your mind?</p>

<p><b>Noah</b>: I never had it before.</p>

<p><b>Me</b>: Okay. So, but chocolate, right? So Devil's food cake.</p>

<p><b>Noah</b>: Why Devil's food cake?</p>

<p><b>Me</b>: Because angel's food cake is vanilla. Devil's food cake is chocolate.</p>

<p><b>Noah</b>: Why?</p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p><b>Me</b>: Racism. </p>

<p>(pause)</p>

<p><b>Me</b>: Should we call them something else instead?</p>

<p><b>Noah</b>: <i>Double's</i> food cake!</p>

<p><b>Me</b>: Double's food cake it is.</p>

<p>I would argue that Angel's Food has a pleasant and somewhat bland taste that invites a moderate, measured approach to eating.  While Devil's Food offers a delicious, not to say addictive, chocolate flavor that tempts one into gluttony and sloth.  But perhaps my reading of the terms is informed by palate bias.</p>

<p>Well of course the chocolate cake is going to be called double's food cake. Since it's chocolate, you'll be eating twice as much as that vanilla cake.</p>

<p>MMMM...chocolate.</p>

<p>I like how Devil's food cake is listed in the Dessert Bible - <br />
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040805042002/http://www.njbbt.org/ripoff1161.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20040805042002/http://www.njbbt.org/ripoff1161.htm</a></p>

<p>As it should be, of course.</p>

<p>That's a lot of cakes. Coen's birthday is on the 16th and my mother usually comes to show off her grandmothering skills by making an insanely ornate cake. Ah - I have a picture: <a href="http://secret.ideacog.net/2008/12/18/birthday-cake/">http://secret.ideacog.net/2008/12/18/birthday-cake/</a></p>

<p>Oh for goodness sakes it's not racism; Devil's Food Cake has more calories and it's more fattening.</p>

<p>It's, um, sizeism. Or whatever that ism is where you confuse thinness with virtue.</p>

<p>I always thought the Angel's Food/Devil's Food cake paradigm was centered around the concept of Aristotelian matter.   </p>

<p>The Angel's Food cake contains more air, which means, according to Aristotle, it has an inclination to rise heavenward.</p>

<p>The denser Devil's Food cake meanwhile contains heavier forms of matter and thus wishes to sink to the depths of the earth (Hades).</p>

<p>--<br />
Wikipedia sort-of backs me up: it claims that Angel's Food cake was named so because of its airiness and its white color; Devil's Food cake was named so because it came out at about the same time and may have possibly been originally red (Red Velvet and Devil's Food cakes apparently took a while to differentiate).</p>

<p>I'm not sure <a href="http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Doppelganger">double</a>'s food is much better.</p>

<p>And what does that make angel food? Singles' food cake?</p>

<p>Well, technically a devil's food cake is made with cocoa, not chocolate (cakes made with chocolate are aptly named "chocolate cakes" :).</p>
