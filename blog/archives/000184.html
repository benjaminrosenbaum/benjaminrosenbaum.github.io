  Orphans from Iceland 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>Got my contributors' copies of <a href="https://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.detail/object_id/3038BE5D-81F8-4A3D-B624-B7B3223E0788/McSweeneysIssue15.cfm">Issue #15</a> of <a href="https://www.mcsweeneys.net">McSweeney's</a>, which contains my story "Orphans". This is the Icelandic Issue, with half the stories in translation from Icelandic and an enclosed weird and tacky Icelandic mini-tabloid. </p>

<p>I am pleased about this. Iceland rocks. It has 290,000 people and publishes 1000 books a year. Everyone in Iceland has to moonlight at several different jobs so that they can pretend they have enough people to be a nation-state with a cosmopolitan, urban center.  A tiny bus stop in the remote north, next to a farmhouse, with nothing else in sight for miles but sheep (always in groups of three), icebergs, and volcanoes, will typically be accompanied by a major piece of expressionist sculpture. Rejkjavik is one of the architecturally coolest cities I've seen. </p>

<p>Hence my tribute to Iceland (Outermost Thule) in that <A href="https://www.allstarstories.com/">Zeppelin</a> story.</p>

<p>Plus, I love Bjork. </p>

<p>However, the rotten, 18-months-buried-in-sand shark they feed tourists: not so much.</p>

<p>That reminds me: Knowing that Benjamin Rosenbaum must have made it off that pirate war-boat alive (since he obviously went on to pen &#8220;A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-Planes&#8221;), if he did decide to pursue that job offer from Prem Ramasson, I wouldn't mind seeing a plausible-fable of Thule-that-might-have-been for <i>Twenty Epics</i>.</p>

<p>Hm!</p>

<p>Except, wouldn't that just be historical nonfiction then?</p>

<p>Does it say anywhere in the guidelines that we don't take non-fiction? </p>

<p>But I think it depends on one's approach to shadow history -- not to mention one's view of causality, naturally. :)</p>
