<p>At Wiscon I heard from Gavin Grant and Kelly Link that Small Beer Press wants to publish a full-length collection of short stories.</p>

<p>By.</p>

<p>Me.</p>

<p>!!</p>

<p><br />
Small Beer published my <a href="http://www.lcrw.net/smallbeer/chapbooks/benjaminrosenbaum.htm">chapbook</a> some years ago. Being published by Small Beer Press is like being carried on a golden hammock strung between the backs of wise purple giraffes through milk chocolate mountains --- otherwise passable only with great moanings and suffering and gnashing of teeth in scurvy-weakened gums --- gently swaying, imagining no ill of anyone, serenaded by manic, blasphemous hummingbirds, fed raspberries by mouse-sized heretical monks who guffaw in their sleeves and hide when the ferrets come, the long sleek pie-eyed ferrets who pay you no notice, but who know what is to come, who know what is to come.</p>

<p>It is, in other words, A Very Good Thing.</p>

<p>I actually have enough stories for a full-length collection. Isn't that spiffy?</p>

<p>The collection is to come out, perhaps, next Wiscon.</p>

<p>Whee!</p>

<p>Thanks everyone! :-)</p>

<p>Jackie, I think they're basically going to pick, though I expect they'll be amenable to my suggestions; also, I'm not sure how many of the unpublished stories are going in. (There are three that are sold and may or may not be out by May). I think it probably won't include the "Other Cities", since those are already in the chapbook.</p>

<p>"As you know, Ben," I would very much like to have "The Frog Comrade" in the kind of format that can be purchased and shared with others -- i.e. not just a fading memory from your reading a year ago. Care to lobby for it on my behalf? Or put me in touch with the Small Brewers re: the three guaranteed sales they'd make with it?</p>

<p>Thanks Zvi & Jessie. (What golden hammock?)</p>

<p>Dan, it's not just an issue of the Small Brewers, but also of, say, the market at which "The Frog Comrade" is currently submitted -- whether they want it, and when they can have it out by -- and if they don't want it, whether there's time to get it published somewhere else before May, or should I just go ahead and have it be the original story in the collection, or sell it elsewhere and have it wait its turn for some future collection. Decisions, decisions...</p>

<p>Awesome! I thought it was going to be Nightshade, or at least thought I heard you say that at some point. I would definetly love to see some of those non-published unavailable stories as well. </p>
