<p>Friday was my tenth wedding anniversary.</p>

<p>I biked with the kids (Noah in the trailer; Aviva proudly <a href="../images/oct2007/avivaBiking.jpg">under her own power</a>) to their grandparents' house and dropped them off. Momi had baked us a <a href="../images/oct2007/pie.jpg">celebratory Linzertorte</a>. It reads "TEN YEARS", inscribed in Baseldüütsch pie crust.</p>

<p>Then Esther and I went out to a <a href="https://www3.bahnhofrestaurants.ch/rest/escargot.htm">fancy restaurant</a>.</p>

<p>The kids slept over at their grandparents'. We woke up the next morning at EIGHT A.M., with <i>no one jumping on us</i>. We had no idea what to do with the peace and quiet.</p>

<p>Since we dilly-dallied for over seven years before getting hitched, I have actually had <a href="../images/oct2007/esther.jpg">this wonderful woman</a> in my life for almost eighteen years now. </p>

<p>Meeting Esther at the age of twenty, and somehow managing to hold onto her even back then when I was relatively clueless, is the kind of luck that leaves me with a certain queer solipsistic unease, as if this whole life thing <i>has</i> to be a setup of some kind. </p>

<p>Of those almost-eighteen years, the last ten, since we stood under a chuppah on a rainy morning in American University's Kay Spiritual Life Center, have been markedly the best. </p>

<p>And getting better all the time.</p>

<p>wow -- herzliche gratulation!</p>

<p>i actually feel exactly the same about this "kind of luck" that makes my life look like a cheap setup. maybe it has to do with being married to a member of the bi&#1077;ri-family?</p>

<p>Congrats!! Funny thing is that I was looking at photos of your wedding last night and wondering exactly when that had been. :)</p>

<p>Aww...sweet!  Congrats, you guys!  Hey, I think you're the only couple of roughly our age who have been together longer than Kev and I have.  Oh, wait, no -- Joe and Karina got together when they were sixteen, so I lie.  But you're second!</p>

<p>I vividly remember that rainy morning ten years ago, and also the love that bloomed 18 years ago, and I feel privileged to have been a witness.</p>

<p>I love the photo of Aviva -- taken with your new camera, I hope?  But the one of Esther, while lovely, needs better focus.  I cannot help responding as a mother, and as a photographer.</p>

<p>Aw! You should have more ten-year anniversaries, because this was the sweetest post ever.</p>

<p>Mary Anne: Nooooooooo! We must be first! (Hatches plan to lure Joe and Karina on round-trip space voyage at significant percentage of lightspeed..)</p>

<p>Mom: Eek, no, they are still with my phone. I have not found a converter to plug in the battery charger into a Swiss wall! But it's on my list!</p>

<p>Karen & Haddayr: Hee, thanks!</p>

<p>Jackie: No more ten-year wedding anniversaries, thank you. Ten-year anniversaries of something else, maybe. :-)</p>

<p>Hi Ben.</p>

<p>Congratualtions on your anniversary!  I remmember that very wet but lovely day.<br />
How many years has it been since we've been in touch?  Instead of cleaning my house today I've been playing on the computer and googling people I still think about, but have no idea where are.  So I found this connection to you.  Aviva's so sweet!  And Esther looks just the same.  Wow.  I would love to e-mail you in a more private way, so it would be great if you could send me your regular e-mail address.  </p>

<p>Send my love to Esther, and if you have a chance, please be in touch.</p>
