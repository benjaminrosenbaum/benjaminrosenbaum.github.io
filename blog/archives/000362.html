<p>Someone named HusyFantasy has apparently done a <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/husyfantasy/Blog/cns!1p1VRAQfSBpL38dk56N17cDQ!120.entry">Chinese translation</a> of <a href="/stories/embracing.the.new.html">"Embracing-the-New"</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A%2F%2Fspaces.msn.com%2Fhusyfantasy%2Fblog%2Fcns%214F7AEE40D4E958FA%21120.entry&langpair=zh-CN%7Cen&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&prev=%2Flanguage_tools">Google's take</a> is pretty funkadelic, though for some reason the URL-based Google translation gives up half way and reverts to Chinese (maybe some clever Javascript that the spider can't get past?)</p>

<p>Pasting the Chinese into the text-based <A href="http://translate.google.com/translate_t">Google Translate</a> yields the full text. I particularly like this, from the ending:</p>

<blockquote>
He needs only one God, God is a need to rally him. But he was unable to figure Yuet U.S. diplomatic goddess. He had betrayed her. He thought the embrace new God, the real God embrace new, denied that the wife and children Slave worms catch, the hand stretched out toward hope....

<p>Remember.     </p>

<p>One beast standing in the courtyard. Wind is cool and the forests that spring up like the taste. Where hunting was about to start.        </p>

<p></blockquote></p>

<p>From the english->chinese->english-portuguese-english:</p>

<p>A god only needs, god is a necessity rally. But diplomatic of Yuet was incapable to appear goddess United States. Betrayed. It thought of the new god of embrace, the new real god embrace, denied that the wife and the children without-ends Slave stop, the hand strained for it are for the hopeÂ…. </p>

<p>To remember. </p>

<p>A crossbow that is in the patio. The wind is cool and the forests that jump above as the taste. Where the hunting was the point to start. </p>

<p>I rather like the English-Chinese-English version:</p>

<p><i>He needs God, God-centred him. But he can not think of life in the U.S. He had betrayed her. he wanted to embrace new, and truly embrace --- new, the lack of figures, to hope. ...</i></p>

<p><i>Remember.</i></p>

<p><i>The animals from the hospital. Wind Qinglie like spring forest flavor. where hunting.</i></p>

<p>Yeah, I love that the goddess "Delighting-In-Beauty" is translated as something having to do with the U.S. I figured HusyFantasy might have done that on purpose, as a meta-comment on the story's origin -- but it looks like the automatic Google English-Chinese-English bot has the same sense of humor?</p>

<p>I can see where they're getting "U.S." -- Chinese for the US is &#32654;&#22269;, "Beautiful Country", and in context &#32654; could therefore mean "American". But I'm really not sure where they're getting "diplomatic".</p>
