<p>If you <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&search-type=ss&index=books&field-author=Benjamin%20Rosenbaum&page=1">search for my name on Amazon</a>, you can see that I had a bit of a problem producing new work between 1929 and 2008. </p>

<p>But now I'm back, baby!</p>

<p>Hmm... I think there's a real obligation for you to  write a story (or preferably, book) entitled "green nakedness" just to truly confuse the issue. </p>

<p>And those actually sound like things you might have written -- I think you need to find out who this other Benjamin Rosenbaum was.</p>

<p>Yeah, I was going to say, "So what's <em>Green Nakedness</em> about? I seem to have missed that one..." but I think Shoshana's point that they do actually sound like things you would have written is an excellent one. So, who was this doppelganger of yours, and what did he write?</p>

<p>Wait a minute...</p>

<p>Ben, have you been working on a time machine and not telling us, all along? If <em>Green Nakedness</em> is, in fact, a cry for help (or a warning!) from a future/past you, I hope it works.</p>

<p>peace<br />

<p>It's not me who builds time machines -- it's my granddaughter <a href="../archives/2004_02.html#000004">Annabelle Rosenbaum-DÃ¼nns Zelt</a>, and while I'm aware that we have been visited by <a href="../archives/2007_09.html#000544">Ben from 1975</a>, I'm not aware of having gone back in time to write Green Nakedness -- my alter ego <a href="http://www.allstarstories.com/rosenbaum-notes.html">told Chippewa Melko as much</a>. So I must be going to have done that later.</p>

<p>Every year on Aviva's birthday, all the Avivas in the timestream whose birthday it is, starting, I believe, with four-year-old Aviva, get together for a big party (I think it's at 57-year-old Aviva's house). I'll have to ask Aviva how it was this year (I mean, it's always the same party, but her perspective varies).</p>

<div class="comments-body">
<p>I wonder what the first three Avivas do...</p>

<p>It may have been an event in your alter-ego's life, then. Or may yet be.</p>

<p>Alternately, it may be that your alter-ego didn't know that, in fact, it will be you, not him.</p>

<p>Seven-year-old Aviva says the party was fun this year, and she showed six-year-old Aviva around.</p>

<p>Tempest, which feed are you looking at? <a href="../atom.xml">This one</a> has the full text as well as the summaries. Is that the one you're talking about?</p>
