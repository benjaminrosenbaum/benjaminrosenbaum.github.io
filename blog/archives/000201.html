<p>Congratulations!<br />
I'd like to know if you're planning to further develop Vru's world - perhaps in several stories, perhaps as a novel?<br />
Have a nice life,<br />

<p>One last question: I'd like to translate your Embracing-The-New story in Romanian. What steps must I make in order to buy the rights and publish your story in a magazine? I was thinking about publishing it in Lumi Virtuale : https://www.lumivirtuale.ro, a bi-monthly scifi magazine.<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Eddie</p>

<p>Hey Eddie, </p>

<p>I have the vague ambition to write some more about Vru's world. I'd like to show the society that Khancriterquee calls the Godless (which is obviously not what they call themselves). A lot of what Vru learned about them is in fact false. Besides the "Godly" and the "Godless", there's another group of tribals who have yet another mode of relating to Ghennungs. </p>

<p>So it's one of those things where I have a lot of worldbuilding/backstory in my head, but I'm waiting for actual *story* to show up. <br />

In case y'all are curious about how I handle my vast empire of foreign rights sales, here's what I sent to Eddie in email about translating:</p>

<p>----</p>

<p>Hi Eddie,</p>

<p>I'd love to see Embracing-The-New in Romanian. If it's a noncommercial context, just go ahead and translate it, and send me a link... and<br />
thank you! If it's a commercial context... well, just go ahead anyway, and thank you for asking. I didn't charge <a href="https://www.zg-naklada.hr/futura/">Futura</a> anything to translate it into Bulgarian, and, you know, I don't want to stir up any cross-border conflicts. :-)</p>

<p>(I'm gambling that that joke will still be funny rather than offensive by the time it crosses the  Atlantic).</p>

<p>Send me a link when it's up!</p>

<p>Ben</p>
