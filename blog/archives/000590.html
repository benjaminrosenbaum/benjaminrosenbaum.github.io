<p>So it looks like the cons I will be flying back to the USA for this year will be <a href="http://www.wiscon.info/index.php">Wiscon</a> and <a href="http://www.denvention3.org/">Worldcon</a>.</p>

<p>So who's going? And who wants to split a hotel bill, preferably many ways, ideally in seedy, cramped, non-governor's-club squalor?</p>

<p>(Interesting: also, if you're going to Worldcon, it looks like they have a <a href="http://www.denvention.org/programming/member_survey.php">survey of who, and what topics, you'd like to see on panels</a>... so make sure to request your favorite panelists and/or slapfights).</p>

<p>Does that mean you don't have roommates? :-)</p>

<p>I don't have a roommate, in fact, and I do want one, but I don't know if I want a bajillion! Maybe I do, convince me. (I do have a room, not that one couldn't become loved and popular by trading it to someone else.)</p>

<p>Ben, I've a room reservation for Wiscon that I have to give up. A nephew's decided to get married that weekend. If you still need a room, it's available, but you'd have to fill it with your own roommates.<br />

<p>BTW, Daniel Abraham said on his LJ that the Worldcon hotels are filling up.</p>

<p>How exciting! I'll see you at both. I may actually have a free spot in a Tor-sponsored room for WisCon; let me know if you're remotely interested. And I'll be doing some kind of share thing for WorldCon--Cat V. and her boy D. are already in, but we could probably take one or two more. Though I should probably actually reserve a room before I offer up nonexistent spots.</p>

<p>I think I'm now all set for Wiscon, but Worldcon is definitely a possibility...</p>

<p>Hi)My name is Carina) I am a translator of your story from Russia)I mean the one named The House Beyond Your Sky) Wonderful tale,though difficult enough, but grandiose. <br />
I have a question,BIG AND CERTAIN: would you be so kind to explain such thing as ONTOTROPIC space? What is it? Some kind of Non-Being? Or OTHER-SPACE? or OTHER-SPHERE?<br />
I believe it's some kind of different form of reality, that is actually NON-REALITY.<br />
Please,I'm just "simple russian entity")))<br />
It would be great pleasure to me if you answer.<br />
Thank you,<br />
Carina.<br />
And by the way: are the Ontotropic and paraspace the same thing?)))<br />
( I'm just asking for your help)Don't knote my timeline,don't drive me to the halting problem))))))</p>
