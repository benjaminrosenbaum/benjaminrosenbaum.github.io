  Bus billboard for religious postmodernists 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>So you know about the war of the billboards, right? The clever <a href="http://www.atheistbus.org.uk/busphotos/DSC_0019.JPG">atheist billboard campaign</a> begun in the UK and various, largely less convincing (because <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/feb/05/atheist-bus-christian-response">derivative</a> or <a href="http://religions-frei.ch/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/Pius-Kampagne.jpg">grumpy</a>)  religious responses. (Other religious people have been ecstatic, like the Swiss religious school teachers I read about whose recalcitrant pupils finally got interested in talking about religion after seeing the atheist billboards on a field trip to London).</p>

<p>The billboards have been a matter of some debate in Switzerland, with various <a href="http://www.swisster.ch/content/swiss-transit-authorities-ban-atheist-advertising">cantonal bus authorities refusing to run the atheists' ads</a>, while running plenty of (Christian) religious ads -- another piece of Switzerland's current abominable xenophobic fit of religious self-righteousness, like the <a href="http://www.minarette.ch/">disgusting referendum this weekend to forbid the construction of minarets</a>, which never ceases to make my blood boil (These damned posters are all over my neighborhood. Hello, German-speaking Europe: targeting individual religious minorities and restricting their civil rights? Haven't we been over this before? If you are Swiss and reading this, please get out and vote this weekend!)</p>

<p>Anyway, back to the billboards. As usual in contemporary public debates over religion, I feel left out.</p>

<p>Here would be my entry (if someone wants to photoshop it up in the right font, I would naturally be obliged):</p>

<blockquote style="border: 2px solid green">There's a God, all right, but don't worry: she's not like they say she is. 

<p>Also, if you prefer a different metaphor, that's okay too.</a><br />

<p>Your wish is my entertaining twenty minutes! http://jimmosk1.home.comcast.net/~jimmosk1/benbus.jpg</p>

<p>(Also, take a look at all the examples shown at http://www.dangeroustalk.net/billboard-wars.html -- I've seen the Philadelphia billboard for a few years now, and a short-lived response billboard a few hundred meters further down the same highway declaring God's existence)<br />

<p>There's been some pro-atheist advertisement posters in the NYC subways that were inspired by the London  campaign. It got a short mention on the local news, but other than that hasn't seemed to cause much controversy here.</p>

<p>I love your billboard choice!  It's very in line with how I think about religion.  Also, I'm amused to note that I know JimMosk IRL and I had no idea he read your blog!</p>
