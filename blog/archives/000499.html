  Expatriating 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>Tomorrow afternoon we are moving to the suburbs of Basel, Switzerland.</p>

<p>It's a seven minute ride to the train station in one direction, a seven minute ride to forests and farmland in the other, three minutes to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/netzwerg/428489064/in/set-72157600012057887/">Little Cousin</a> and ten or so to the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/netzwerg/306830270/in/set-72157594312988993/">Big Cousin</a>... all by bike. We won't have a car.</p>

<p>I'll be coding three days a week, on-duty parenting the remainder, and writing mornings with <a href="http://chrononaut.org/log">Mr. Moles</a> at a coffee shop.</p>

<p>I think it'll be nice.</p>

<p>But I'm going to miss the people here somethin' terrible.<br />

<p>You know, with all the talk of forests and farmland, I was sure "the Little Cousin" and "the Big Cousin" were names of geological features... Have a safe trip!</p>

<p>We've been a continent away for nigh on a year now, so why not add an ocean?  Have a really great auto-less time.</p>

<p>I shared Dan's misconception - isn't that funny?</p>

<p>I hope Aviva and Noah settle in easily, and that the trip isn't too grueling for you grumps, too. We just drove up to western New York with Luke, and ye cats! Ten hours in a car is a lot for a 3-year-old. Since he and Noah are so close in age, I can only imagine what an intercontinental trip would be like...</p>

<p>peace<br />

<p>Hooray for re-joining the ranks of ex-pat writers! Enjoy those coffeeshop writing mornings - mm, I envy you the Swiss coffee and chocolate. (I'm eating a Swiss chocolate bar right now, but I feel strongly that they must taste *even better* when eaten in Switzerland itself!) Good luck settling in again. </p>

<p>Thanks for the links to Big and Little Cousins -- Eric and I marveled over how unrecognizable Seraphina is (we haven't seen her since Aviva's birth -- she's no longer blonde!) and how much like Jonas and Rahel Filipa looks (please tell Rahel the photos are beautiful).</p>

<p>By the way, we miss you very much. Zula says "Aviva" and "Noah" about 20 times a day, and when I tell her , sadly, "We'll see them in October" she shakes her head vigorously and says, "No, Mommy, SOON!" I think she thinks their disappearance is all my fault.<br />
We love you lots, S.E.Z.</p>

<p>I hope that your move went as smoothly as possible... Mine was crazy, of course! I thought of you while I was packing things up and moving 'em... and it made me feel not so all alone in the world. :-) </p>

<p>Now, tell us more about this Switzerland experience. </p>

<p>Matt: So, Ben, how are you finding Switzerland?</p>

<p>Ben: Well, I just roll out of bed in the morning, and there it is.</p>

<p>*ba-DUM*</p>

<p>Seriously, though. You good?</p>

<p>Somewhere in Movable Type, y'all, a blog entry on the new life in Basel shambles to be born. For serious.</p>

<p>Short answer: good.</p>
