  "How are you?" 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>In an IM conversation the other morning, it suddenly occurred to me for the very first time, what this "how are you?" question means. </p>

<p>(Americans, of course, ask the question twice, which confuses Europeans. When we greet you at the door we say "Hi! How you doin'? Come sit down!" This first "how are you?" is phatic; it's a synonym for "hello". We don't want to know, yet. Then, when we have gotten coffee and sat down, we say, "so... how <i>are</i> you?" Then we want you to tell us. It's this second question I'm referring to.)</p>

<p>I have always found it a frustrating question to answer, because I sort of feel under pressure to produce some kind of statistically accurate survey of my life. Like I ought to assign a rating each to health, parenting, day job, writing, finances, life management, marriage, sports, travel, entertainment, social life, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabbai">gabbanut</a>, reactions to politics and art and events in the wider world -- each one of which would itself, of course, be an average across finer-grained subregions (e.g. "the novel's going slow, but I just wrote a short story")... and integrate across them to yield up a quantitative summary, a "Great!", "Fine", or "Not so good."</p>

<p>Because it is always "great!" in some regards and "not so good" in others, isn't it?</p>

<p>Since most people do not have such difficulties, I would wonder whether other people's various realms of life were more likely to travel in phase with one another than mine; or if other people usually had some monumental event going on, good or bad, which drowned out all other signals.</p>

<p>But now I've finally figured out what the question actually means.</p>

<p>It doesn't mean "give me a statistically accurate reading on your total state." It just means "tell me a true story about your life right now"! </p>

<p>This means I can actually, in good conscience, construct a narrative capturing <i>just one</i> particular salient facet of my life. That is a much easier problem! Instead of suffering the acute cognitive load of some kind of total survey, I can just pick a topic and begin!</p>

<p>Imagine the improved conversational efficiencies I am about to reap!</p>

<p>So, in this regard anyway, I am doing great! </p>

<p>How are you?</p>

<p>Randall Munroe also once had <a href="http://xkcd.com/222/">this observation</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for this insight! I am having exactly the same problems you describe. I will try and implement your solution.</p>

<p>This is particularly to the point because one of the questions answered by your choice of story is <i>what is uppermost in your thoughts right now (that you are willing to share)?</i> Or even <i>what aspects of your life shall we talk about</i>?</p>

<p>If I ask you how you are, and you start with <i>Well, those kids of mine are a hoot; the other day&#8230;</i> , then you are looking for that conversation. If you start with <i>I can't seem to shake this cold</i>, that's a different one. <i>I just read this terrific book</i> is another good answer.</p>

<p>I am looking for signals of levels of intimacy, among other things, but your choice of which true story is also going to tell me more about how you <i>are</i> than a statistical analysis.</p>

<p>Although, now that I think about it, pulling out a chart would be really funny. There's probably an app for that.</p>

<p>Thanks,<br />

<p>I am an automaton, posting to your weblog in order to sell pharmaceutical aphrodisiacs or games of chance - I didn't regret the decision to type, rather than copy and paste, the first part of this comment until I got to "pharmaceutical aphrodisiacs." How are you?</p>

<p>Oh for goodness sakes the answer is always 'fine!' Life is not always complicated. HARUMPH.</p>

<p>No, Haddayr, that's the <i>first</i> how are you. If, after I say "how are you?" and you say "fine", and we take off our coats, sit down, order food, stretch, and dish about the waiter, I then say, "so -- Haddayr. How <i>are</i> you?", you <i>then</i> say, "Fine", it means "bug off, let's talk about something less intimate and more cerebral." </p>

<p>That cannot <i>always</i> be the answer...?</p>

<p>For some odd reason, I think there was a Garfield cartoon (of all things) on the same topic.</p>

<p>Couldn't find it, but it was something along the lines of someone asking Garfield, "How are you?"</p>

<p>Garfield then responds "Do you mean that in the meaningless social fluff kind of way, or do you actually want to know?"</p>

<p>The other says "The meaningless social fluff..."</p>

<p>To which he replies, "Ah!  Fine, how are you?"</p>

<p>There is a chance I'm confusing it with another comic.</p>

<p>In unrelated yet bizarre news, we are 3 links distant on LinkedIn, so I know someone who knows someone who knows you professionally apparently.</p>
