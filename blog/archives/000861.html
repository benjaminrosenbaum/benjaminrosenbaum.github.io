<p>I've been awfully remiss about letting you all know, Constant Readers, about what's going on over here at the Vast Publishing Empire that is Benjamin Rosenbaum<SUP><SMALL>TM</SMALL></SUP>&reg; AG , Inc., LLC. </p>

<p>Recent highlights:</p>

<ol>
<li> "<a href="">The House Beyond Your Sky</a>" was translated by Florence Dolisi as "<a href="http://www.angle-mort.fr/fiction/la-maison-derriere-le-ciel-benjamin-rosenbaum/">La maison derri&eacute;re la ciel</a>" and published in <a href="http://www.angle-mort.fr/">Angle Mort</a>, a newish French webzine patterned on the <a href="www.lightspeedmagazine.com/">Lightspeed</a> model.

<p><li>"<a href="http://www.allstarstories.com/rosenbaum-siege.html">A Siege of Cranes</a>" was translated as"Un volo di gru" by Davide Marra (who has a story in the same issue, "Pianeta Rossa", in which <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Garibaldi">Garibaldi</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giovanni_Battista_Belzoni">Belzoni</a> meet on Mars!), in <a href="http://www.arpnet.it/cs/alia/alia.htm">ALIA 6</a>. </p>

<p>Interestingly mine is the only story in the issue from the USA; there are also seven original stories from Italy, and 14 other translations -- 6 from Japan, 4 from Singapore, 3 from China, and one from Spain. I don't know if this is a special issue, or if Alia always mostly looks eastward for inspiration.</p>

<p><li> <a href="http://www.allstarstories.com/rosenbaum-notes.html">"Biographical Notes to 'A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-Planes', by Benjamin Rosenbaum"</a> was reprinted in Rachel Swirsky & Sean Wallace's Jewish SF/F anthology, <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781607012382-1">People of the Book</a>, and "The King of the Djinn" (by me and David Ackert) was reprinted in Tim Pratt's anthology <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio/1-9781597801898-0">Sympathy for the Devil</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../images/spring2011/pubsMar2011.JPG" width="550" height="309" /></p>

<p><li>My Danish collection, <a href="http://www.sciencefiction.dk/udgivelser/boger/start-uret.html">Start uret</a>, has gone to a second printing! This is the first time, I believe, that anything of mine has gone to a second printing! </p>

<p>Admittedly the first printing was only 100 copies. But then, there are only 6 million Danish speakers worldwide, so that's the equivalent of 8,333 copies in English. In translator Lise Andreasen's words, it is selling like warm bread.</p>

<p><li>I <a href="../archives/2009_06.html#000740">posted some time ago</a> about Todd Sanders' miraculous hand-crafted artisanal editions of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/earldumarest/3600461109/">A Siege of Cranes</a>, <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/earldumarest/3428118202/">"Biographical Notes to 'A Discourse on the Nature of Causality, with Air-Planes' by Benjamin Rosenbaum"</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/earldumarest/3539020693/">The House Beyond Your Sky</a>. </p>

<p>Now he has created a line of steampunk games based in part on the aforementioned "Biographical Notes..." (I have to tell you, when I wrote this story I had no idea I was <a href="http://oldcharliebrown.livejournal.com/355231.html">committing steampunk</a>); they include <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/92186/aether-captains-pirates-and-traders">Aether Captains: Pirates and Traders</a>, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/638457/aether-captains-triad">Aether Captains: Triad</a>, <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/91038/aether-captains-dread-supremacy">Aether Captains: Dread Supremacy</a>, and <a href="http://tinyurl.com/4m8gj7w">Aether Captains: Capek Golems</a>. I believe <a href="http://spanglemakermidsummerfires.blogspot.com/2011/02/aether-captains-great-race.html">Aether Captains: The Great Race</a> is still in progress.</p>

<p><img src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2wa7oX9F4L8/TX5gfshlvwI/AAAAAAAABkU/UJUF4RxYGOA/s1600/DSCF6375.JPG"width="432" height="293" /></p>

<p>These are Creative Commons'd, DIY, free Print and Play games -- you can download and print out the PDFs, assemble dice and tokens, and start hunting airship pirates in the skies over <a href="http://aanpress.com/game/acrt/arkady2.png">Arkady</a>.  </p>

<p>It seems <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_85pyegbu_qM/TS9DIiDjFZI/AAAAAAAABZk/ycCFlipOn9k/s1600/captains2.png">Grigor Karthagonov</a>, carefree jackanape though he may be, has time to captain an airship while also expounding his philosophical typology of action and motive (or perhaps this Karthagonov is a descendant of the philosopher...)<br />

<p>Wow! I can't wait to take a look at that game.</p>

<p>...and a friend of mine has a little Danish. I may have to send her some warm, printed bread.</p>

<p>Oh, even better! It's a solitaire game! (Getting a game group together is hopeless for me these days).</p>

<p>AND it asks for a d12, the best die of them all. AWESOME.</p>

<p>Which one are you talking about, Dan? I think there's a variety, I forget which one was the solitaire game...</p>

<p>thanks ben for posting this. the original that started it all http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/86003/aether-captains - Aether Captains is solo as is Pirates and Traders and one of the games in Triad. and my latest, just posted - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/96703/aether-captains-clockwork-cabal  - Clockwork Cabal, is solo also and uses a d12, which is my favorite underrated die as well.</p>

<p>and yes i think this Grigor is a descendant of your Grigor. jackanapes are notoriously bad philosophers.</p>
