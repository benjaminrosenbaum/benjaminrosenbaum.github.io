<p>Bjork is rather remarkable.</p>

<p>I pictured Shar and Narra as being less mechanical - more bioengineered... Maybe these are early prototypes of the line that yeilded Shar and Narra?</p>

<p>Also, the first link didn't work for me, but I knew the video you were talking about and found it here.</p>

<i> I pictured Shar and Narra as being less mechanical - more bioengineered </i></p>

<p>They're neither; they're some polymorphously perverse future tech that makes genetic engineering look like Lego. But like the association of Marilyn Monroe with sex, </p>

<blockquote>
Today Shar is Marilyn Monroe. That's an erotic goddess from prehistoric cartoon mythology. She has golden curls, blue eyes, big breasts, and skin of a shocking pale pink. She stands with a wind blowing up from Hades beneath her, trying to control her skirt with her hands, forever showing and hiding her white silk underwear.
</blockquote>

<p> ...the association of solder, wires, hydraulics and sparky connections with myths of identity, mortality and the nature of being alive has been passed on as part of the mythic unconscious. They don't really know what that ancient tech would be <i>for</i> -- they just know it's associated with the ancient slur, "robot", and the ancient questions about being real, with the myths of Pinnochio and Frankenstein.</p>

<p>That's what I mean by, in the video, they're in a retro Japanese-factory mood. :-)</p>
