  Boys Shooting 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>We are always trying to pry details of her time at playgroup out of Aviva. </p>

<p>She hates it when the boys shoot at her with imaginary pistols. </p>

<p>Jonathan -- the prime culprit -- also was poking her a bunch. She would crawl under the table to escape and he would pursue her. She was quite upset about this.</p>

<p>I suggested various approaches. "Did you ask him to stop?" "Did you tell Miss Halima?"</p>

<p>Aviva greeted these with "Yes", and a tolerant, sad expression that said that, of course, one cannot expect adults to provide anything really useful, or help at all, and one must have compassion for their ineptitude.</p>

<p>"Okay," I said, "Shall I teach you karate?"</p>

<p>I don't think she knew the word, but her expression changed instantly -- she could somehow tell at once that this was a real answer, as opposed to crapola.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not nuts. I'm not going to teach Aviva strikes. She is not above using them.</p>

<p>Blocks, however, are fair game. So we've been practicing circular "wax on, wax off" blocks against poking. She's pretty good at them. I tried to work on her stance, but that just confused her, so I stopped.</p>

<p>We haven't heard any more about Jonathan poking her, though.</p>

<p>However, he still shoots at her, and she hates that.</p>

<p>Apparently Camran sometimes shoots at her, too, but he's also nice; when she was upset about her bread being broken, he came over and said, "look, my bread is broken too," which has endeared him to Aviva forever.</p>

<p>Anyone have any ideas? What can Aviva do about the boys shooting?</p>

<p>Well, there's always saying "pei-ong!" while pantomining the bullet richochetting off one's chest. It may not stop the boys shooting at her, but perhaps she'd feel better if she could demonstrate that the bullets have no effect.</p>

<p>She could crush their heads.  It's an old Kids in the Hall sketch.  Do you know it?</p>

<p>Ooo, good suggestions! :-)</p>

<p>She told a story about Jonathan yesterday which was somewhat garbled, but the import seemed to be that a) he told her not to sit next to him, and b) he wasn't bothering her any more because she wasn't playing with him. She didn't sound dejected, though -- more intrigued, and perhaps a bit smug.</p>

<p>So I'm wondering, knowing my daughter, if she found some subtle way of retaliating by pestering him, and he's now fleeing her.</p>

<p>There are two Sydneys in playgroup, too. The one who is Aviva's friend, and the one who Isn't. The friendly Sydney said Aviva could sit next to *her*.</p>
