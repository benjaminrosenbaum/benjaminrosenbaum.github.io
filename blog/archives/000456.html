<i>Turn to page 123 in your work-in-progress. (If you havent gotten to page 123 yet, then turn to page 23. If you havent gotten there yet, then get busy and write page 23.) Count down four sentences and then instead of just the fifth sentence, give us the whole paragraph.</i><br />
<blockquote></p>

<p>Fift's parental cohort were mostly liberal Kumruists. That is to say, they were adherents of a religion which frowned on prenatal polysomatic engineering while it venerated the act of birth as a central mystery. Competition for who was to bear his single initial body had thus, naturally, been intense, and it was no surprize that the Younger Sibling of that particular Struggle was Mother Pip. Pip, a grand, fat, intimidating personage, very high-strung for a Pale, had had himself specifically outfitted with ovaries, uterus, and vagina, and required the rest of Fift's parents to acquire penises, the week of the (very traditional) impregnation. </p>

<p>Is this *really* on page 123, or were you just looking for the teasiest teaser you could find?</p>

<p>It's actually page 23; I'm not up to page 123 yet.</p>

<p>Is it particularly teasy?</p>

<p>who can tell?  I'd have to read the whole book to see if this is the teasiest bit.  Of course, any world where one is at liberty to choose who has to actually give birth is of interest to me...  Will childbirth hurt Pip as it hurts the rest of us, or have you got that far yet?</p>

<p>Good thing I don't have a blog. I'd be reporting from page 3..</p>
