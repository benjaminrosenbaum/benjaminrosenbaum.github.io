  Wiscon Schedule 2016

<p>Wiscon Ahoy!</p>

<div class="schedule"> 
<div class="date">Friday</div> 
</div> 
<div class="schedule"> 
<div class="title"><a href="https://account.wiscon.net/program/detail?idItems=3379"> Group, Individual, Hive Mind</a></div> 
<div class="time">4:005:15 pm
   <div class="where">Conference 1</div> 
</div> 
<div class="what"> You think it's obvious where you leave off and everyone else begins? Maybe it's not so obvious, not among human cultures, and certainly not in biology. What is an individual? What is a group? How does the identity of "individual" and "group" vary? After exploring variations in earthly organization, we'll tackle SF where alien characters originate from different types of social or biological organization. Who creates characters that truly reflect those differences? Who can't quite shake human-centered or dominant-culture-centered myopia?</div> 
<div class="who"> Annalee Newitz, Grá Linnaea, Benjamin Rosenbaum, Isabel Schechter, R. Elena Tabachnick</div>

<div class="schedule">

<div class="time">2:30-3:45 pm
   <div class="where">Michaelangelo's</div> 
</div> 
<div class="what">Ill-advised teen romance. Getting apprenticed to an evil wizard. Shady doings in Riverside. Dislocated portal-fantasy refugees or frumm zombie hunters. Or maybe something else altogether. How did we get here? Our feeling of dread is barely matched by exhilaration. Come witness our folly.</div>

<div class="schedule"> 
<div class="title"><a href="https://account.wiscon.net/program/detail?idItems=3532">How Does One Write Near Future SF?</a></div> 
<div class="time">  4:005:15 pm
   <div class="where">University C</div> 
</div> 
<div class="what">We are looking at global warming, resource wars, the migration of large numbers of people, a fragile world economic system and a world political system that seems unable to deal seriously with real problems. How does a writer extrapolate from this mess into the future?</div>

<p><br />
My son Noah is also on two panels this year: "Introverts Rock! (Quietly ... Alone in Their Rooms.)" and "Kids Speak 2". He was on "Kids Speak" last year and it was a terrific panel -- honestly, one of the best panels of the con. I hope they get some more kids signed up this year, though, as there are only two names on the schedule. Esther and Aviva are coming too. Aviva is looking forward to All teh Panelz. The kids are, however, bummed that they're missing the Hamilton Sing-a-long on Friday. They would have rocked it.</p>

<p>I'll also be playtesting Shtetl World, very excited about that. If you want to see that or another game I'm working on, <i>Sing Your Heart Out!</i>, ask me at the con.</p>

<p>I love the Time Travel theme for the Floomp but I'm a little hurting on outfit, so if anyone wants to help me floomp up, please let me know.</p>

<p>So many people I adore go to Wiscon. (Others will be missed). It's one of my favorite weekends of the year.</p>

<p>My friend, Meghan Ellison, who wrote a lovely book called, "The Book of the Unnamed Midwife," is, also, at Wisconsin and I would be thoroughly delighted if the two of you met. I sent you two a group FB message.</p>
