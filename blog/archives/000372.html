  Addendum to A Song By Noah, who is Two and a Half (updated)

<p>So Noah sang that song (variously known as "Pepperoni Yoyo" and "I float away in the morning") while we were at the situated-above-well-hidden-supervillain's-lair Omega Institute, specifically in the cafe. This was several weeks ago.</p>

<p>In response to the foregoing post, <a href="../sounds/PepperoniYoyo.mp3">Matt recorded his version</a> of the song. I played it for Noah and he was very excited. <b>(Um... in case you clicked that before and it didn't work, try it again)</b></p>

<p>"It's called Pepperoni Yoyo," I said.</p>

<p>"That's not Pepperoni Yoyo that's I float away in the morning," Noah said. "I singed Pepperoni Yoyo in Omega school and I singed I float away in the morning in the cafe!"</p>

<p>Or something along those lines.</p>

<p>Aviva was also very gratified, at the mention of her yoyo, and set about composing some lyrics of her own, for Luke's daddy to record.</p>
