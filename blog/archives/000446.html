(... with some lovely other kids, but rather than including them without permission I just cropped 'em.)

<p>What's that game you're playing? I can't quite make it out...</p>

<p>It's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Gamewright-303-Go-Away-Monster/dp/B00001TPYA/benjaminrosenbau/">Go Away Monster!</a> and it is an awesome game, perfect for three-year-olds, a bit young for Aviva perhaps</p>

<p>Cute!</p>

<p>Even if it's a bit young for her, is it a game where she and Noah can meet and both enjoy it on their own terms? (I'm on play terms with a six-year-old girl and her three-year-old brother, and I'm casting around for activities that let both of them play with me at once instead of one feeling left out.)</p>

<p>Oh yeah. They both enjoyed it. He just seemed somewhat more into it. With board games, I think you definitely want to slant it towards the younger one. Ideally you want to pick something that works as a challenging game for the younger and a casual social game for the older... you can always keep the older one entertained with table-side conversation...</p>

<p>Sweet!</p>

<p>On New Year's Eve this year, P & J and I were driving home just past midnight, and J rolled down his window to shout "HAPPY NEW YEAR!" to everyone we passed on the street.  Someone shouted back "I love you!" and J thought that was just the coolest thing ever.<br />
