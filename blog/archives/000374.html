<p>This was the first story I ever sold -- the check arrived on my 30th birthday, in the year 2000. I was confused by the envelope. I was expecting my plain white, self-addressed, stamped envelope back, with a rejection letter in it. Instead, it was one of those commercially printed window envelopes, with my name, printed, showing through the window.</p>

<p>It looked like a bill, and I stood there, puzzled, thinking, "but I just renewed my F&SF subscription a month ago..."</p>

<p>And then I stooped, squinting, and hardly dared to believe the words: "pay to the order of..."</p>

<p><center><hr width="20%"/></center></p>

<p>I still like the story. As absurdist stories with magical gumballs go, I think it's a pretty accurate record of the time and place that inspired it. And recently someone pointed out that you can't find it anywhere, and I really ought to <A href="http://creativecommons.org">CC</a> it.</p>

<p>So here it is, for your reading, forwarding, and remixing pleasure. Put it on party balloons and t-shirts. Create rock operas about it. Write sequels. Translate it into American Sign Language. (And, as usual, if you find yourself in danger of making money off it, drop me a line.)</p>

<p>So here it is: <a href="/stories/the.ant.king.html">The Ant King: A California Fairy Tale</a></p>

<p>Thanks Anon! I wonder if the typo was in F&SF as well. Now fixed.</p>

<p><br />
Thanks james for the kind words. I also like the yellow bird -- of course, it's lifted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>.<br />
Dave, thanks so much for offering the story in Plucker!</p>

<p>Pablo, I don't have the tools to create PDF, but if someone else wants to...? :-)</p>

<p>Actually, the bird and rod are from the first computer adventure game, "Adventure" by Will Crowther and Don Woods, 1976  - now called "Original Adventure" or "Colossal Cave Adventure", and the inspiration for Zork.</p>

<p>There is a lot of crap on the Internet, as anyone who spends much time enjoying it knows.  This, though, was really fantastic, figuratively and literally.  Thank you!</p>

<p>Also, there's a tiny typo:</p>

<p>Im not sure, sir. Hes quite busy these days, with out acquisition of Suriname.</p>

<p>Not to presume or anything, but that should be "our acquisition".</p>
