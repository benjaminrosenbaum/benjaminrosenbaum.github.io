  WisCon Report, part 1 
  </font>
</font></b>

<p>I spent Memorial Day Weekend at <a href="http://www.sf3.org/wiscon">WisCon</a>, "The World's Only Feminist Science Fiction Convention". </p>

<p>That I went to WisCon is a result primarily of <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/StaffBios.shtml#KarenMeisner">Karen Meisner</a>'s use of the classic marketing strategy of repetition. I already was intrigued by the idea of a feminist science fiction convention. I already knew many cool people were going there -- it's <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange Horizons'</a> home convention and a major hub of literary, stylistically innovative, and politically engaged science fiction and fantasy. I already knew I would have a lot of fun there. </p>

<p>But this is not how the human brain works. Knowing something is a good idea is usually insufficient motivation to do it.</p>

<p>At the World Fantasy Convention, every five minutes that we were in the same room, Karen and I would have a conversation that went like this:</p>

<p>Me: "Gee, this sure is fun."<br />
Karen: "Come to WisCon"</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Me: "Ha, how cute. Your son sounds like a great kid."<br />
Karen: "Come to WisCon."</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>Me: "Hmm, the tuna melt looks pretty good."<br />
Karen: "Come to WisCon."</p>

<p>So I did.</p>

<p><center><img SRC="../images/sep.gif" height=31 width=50></center></p>

<p>So why do I go to these things?</p>

<p>Here are some people I hung out with at WisCon. Okay, one or two I just waved at. But I got to have real conversations with most of them. I got to dance and sing (Karaoke at the brilliant Ratbastards party, impromptu showtunes in the hallway with Nisi and Andrea and Sheree and some unknown people whose names I forgot, including those whom I will call Amazing Jazz Voice Woman and Boisterous Show Tune Man) with many of them. I got books by some of them. I signed books for others of them. I was on panels with some of them. But mainly we talked; mainly I had long, impassioned conversations of the kind ordinary life somehow provides too little time for. ..</p>

<p>And there are others whose names my sleep-deprived brain did not store.</p>

<p>It was way too much fun.</p>

<p>I was on some panels. I shall attempt to summarize some of their conclusions soon. In the meantime, <a href="http://www.journalscape.com/AndrewN/2004-06-02-00:30">AndrewN</a> gives a thorough summary of one, the "Happy Writers & Fast Writers" panel  (I am happy, though not, by any means, fast).</p>

<p>It sounds awesome, Ben. I know Steph has always wanted to go, so it's on our "must find the money to get to one day" list.</p>

<p>It was really great seeing you again, Ben, and getting to see you sing and dance.  You had more energy on Monday morning without yet having coffee than I do after three cups.</p>

<p>(Btw, Janet's last name is Chui.)</p>

<p>Oh, man, that's the second time I've made an embarassing error with regard to Janet (first I confused her with someone else). Sheesh.</p>
