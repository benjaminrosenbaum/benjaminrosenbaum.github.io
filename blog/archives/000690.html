<p>Since <a href="http://www.sfsignal.com/archives/006846.html">there's</a> <a href="http://www.cheryl-morgan.com/?page_id=1360">an</a> <a href="http://www.tobiasbuckell.com/2007/05/08/diversity-in-fiction-markets/">ongoing</a> <a href="http://theangryblackwoman.wordpress.com/2007/05/02/how-to-promote-diversity-in-fiction-markets/">conversation</a> in speculative fiction publishing on gender representation in short fiction markets (where gender, I think, tends to get used as a proxy for all kinds of issues of inclusion, since it's relatively easy to measure and there's a gut feeling that there are, or ought to be, about as many women as men involved in the enterprise), I thought I'd offer -- as a data point -- the figures for Tumbarumba (the <a href="http://turbulence.org">Turbulence</a>-funded art project that <a href="http://www.ethanham.org">Ethan Ham</a> and I will be releasing December 1st).</p>

<p>On the "front end", where the user sits, Tumbarumba is a conceptual internet artwork, but on the "back end", from the perspective of the authors, it's an invitation-only anthology of short fiction. It was invitation-only because I don't really aspire to editing as a calling, so while I liked the idea of this project, I wanted to do as little editing work as possible on it. That meant asking people who I thought would be interesting, singly and mixed together, and who I had a strong sense would reliably produce something I would love. And then, of course, they had to actually have time and want to be involved with something as strange as this project.</p>

<p>I didn't want to ask too <i>many</i> people -- I had a limited number of stories I could take, and I wanted to try and get just those stories: any rejections would be a sign of inefficiency. In the end, I did reject some stories, I asked for lots of rewrites, and stories were pulled or didn't get done in time; but by and large it was a pretty efficient process nonetheless. I sent initial mails to 36 people -- some of them long shots. Twenty (56%) said yes or maybe, fourteen (39% of asked) submitted stories, of which twelve (33% of asked) will be fed into the Art Machine.</p>

<p>And here is the gender breakdown:<br />
<center><table style="cell-padding: 3px" border="2"><tr><th colspan="2"><i>Tumbarumba: a frolic of intrustions</i> gender stats</th><tr><td >% male, of those asked</td><td>58%</td></tr><tr><td>% male, of those who said yes or maybe</td><td>65%</td></tr><tr><td>% male, of those who actually submitted</td><td>71%</td></tr><tr><td>% male, of those accepted</td><td>67%</td></tr></table></center></p>

<p>I don't get it.  So where's the female stats?</p>

<p>In this particular instance, all of our contributors happened to be either male or female.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention that. :-)</p>

<p>I got that much. But how can you call it a gender breakdown when you only list the male stats?</p>

<p>I was a bit confused about that at first because I mentally added an "of" into the stats (i.e., "% [of] males who said yes or maybe").</p>

<p>But what Ben means is "The percentage of all who said yes or maybe who are male."</p>

<p>So the stats could also be presented as:</p>

<p>% female asked 42%<br />
% female who said yes or maybe 35%<br />
% female who actually submitted 29%<br />
% female who are in the project 33%</p>

<p>Yes, Mom, my snotty remark was meant to indicate that the female stats would be 100 minus the male stats.</p>

<p>It is true that the table could be interpreted as meaning "58% of all males were asked" -- this would, however, require me to have sent out over two billion emails, making me the King of All Spammers.</p>

<p>But, okay, okay, I will clarify the wording....</p>

<p>Thank you, Ethan, for clarifying.  So, Ben, the point is that even though you asked nearly as many females as males, the bottom line is you got only 33% females represented.  It sounds like the percentage of girls we get (at best) at TIC Summer Camp, whose combination of computer learning and sports seems to attract scads of boys.  </p>
