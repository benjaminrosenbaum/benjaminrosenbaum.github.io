<p><a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=pTsBal7PIWFOKA36DdqBgDw">As you can see</a>, the last month was pretty much a dead zone as far as progress on <a href="../archives/2008_07.html#000643"><i>Resilience</i></a> is concerned. After a post-Worldcon inspired writing tear (from 8/22 through 10/9, the wordcount leapt up from 49,072 to 60,542 -- I know, <a href="https://www.journalscape.com/tim/">for some of you</a> that would be a very slow month indeed, but for me it's a tear) I hit a wall on 10/9 and wordcount was frozen until the other day, when I began haltingly crawling forward again.</p>

<p>I use two projected completion dates in that spreadsheet, mostly for  motivational purposes. The first is based on the <b>average progress over the whole stretch</b> since I moved to Switzerland, and its psychological purpose is mainly calming: the sense that, even if it looks bleak at the moment, over the long haul it is predictable that I will <i>someday</i> finish the first draft's projected 90,000 words. That date, with a lot of inertia behind it, doesn't move much: on 9/24, in the midst of the month of extreme productivitly, the calmer, more conservative voice of my spreadsheet told me I'd have a first draft done on <b>August 24, 2009</b> (just after  turning 40); now, after a month of languishing, that same calm voice predicts <b>October 1, 2009</b>: more or less the same ballpark.</p>

<p>Then there is the <b>14-day moving average</b>. The psychological purpose of this date is to project how I'm doing <i>lately</i>, to give me a sense of how things will be <i>if this go on</i>. Rather than a calming effect, it is invigorating or excoriating, depending on the previous two weeks. It is the wild-eyed, emotionally mercurial counterpart to the total average's calm sobriety. On 9/24. mid-sprint, <i>this</i> voice, whipped into a frenzy of enthusiasm, promised me a finished draft <i>by <b>the end of this year</b></i>; now, thrown down into a pit of abject, desperate despair, it moans that I will type "The End" on <b>February 17th, 2010</b> (back in June, it was claiming 2015).</p>

<p>The nice thing about having these two numbers is I can pick the one I like better. So naturally, last month I fully believed the 14-day moving average's grandiose claims that we'd be done soon; this month, I dismiss its moaning as an absurd overreaction, and console myself with its sober sibling's predictions of next summer.</p>

<p>Anyway, a lot of things conspired this past month to throw me off-course:</p>

<ul>
<li>Esther was sick, on and off, for a couple of weeks; the result of which is that I am some 30 or so <a href="../archives/2008_06.html#000634">chores ahead</a>. It's like banking writing time! 
<li>I went to <a href="../archives/2008_10.html#000679">Villa Diodati</a>. For this I wrote a new story, or, more properly, resurrected and finished an old false start, "Ralph and Billy", a vampire farce I started in 1999 or so. I also, of course, read and critiqued all the stories of the other folks who were going.
<li>At Villa Diodati I got excellent critiques on three children's book projects -- "The Way to Go", "Bad Days in KidLand", and an abecedary -- which have been languishing. Upon returning from the workshop I therefore had to quick do another draft of each of these.
<li>Lots of sleep lost obsessing over <a href="../archives/2008_11.html#000684">the elections</a> and their aftermath.
<li> And last but not least... <a href="https://www.ethanham.com">Ethan Ham</a> and I have a new art project (cf. <a href="https://anthroptic.org">Anthroptic</a>, our last one), which we will be rolling out on the first of December. It essentially takes, on one level, the form of an anthology of short stories -- at least, the work I've been doing on it, especially this last month, is essentially the work of editing an original anthology. On another level, it is a conceptual artwork, kind of a ubiquitous web installation... well, you'll see.

<p>It is called "<b>Tumbarumba: a frolic of intrusions</b>". More here soon on that topic.<br />
<li> Oh, and a bunch of <a href="https://migwan.ch">Migwan</a> business.<br />
</ul></p>

<p>So you would think that that would all be sufficient excuse for a month off, right? Still, I'm half-regretting it. It's so incredibly grueling to start writing a novel again when the ashes are cold in the fireplace. I always ask: why the <i>hell</i> do you do this to yourself?</p>

<p>Very sufficient excuse, I'd say... of course it's a bit ironic that it coincides with NANOWRIMO. </p>

<p>Perhaps there is some sort of conservation of novel progress such that since so many people on the planet are furiously trying to complete a novel this month - those who have been doing this all along get their momentum sapped to fuel others?</p>

<p>Oh.. and I think the answer to "why the hell do you do this to yourself?" is that you cannot not do it.</p>

<p>Sadly, that probably <i>is</i> the reason, though it's worth noting that the "this" in question was not <i>writing</i>, but <i>stopping writing</i> in the middle of something...</p>

<p>Ah.. so the full question is "why the hell do I ever stop writing in the middle of something?" - I get it :)</p>
