<p><i>Resilience</i> is currently on hiatus, as I am working fiendishly on a collaborative YA novel with Paul Melko to get it ready for him to take to the Blue Heaven novel writer's workshop.</p>

<p>He informs me I have 8000 words due by Friday.</p>

<p>(Mind you, I'm just revising, he already wrote the first draft. But still. Yeargh!)</p>

<p>Zzzzzz... *snarch**... what? huh? Oh, sorry, did you ask something?</p>

<p>Ok, I wasn't going to ask, because it seemed weird and intrusive, and it may yet be, but the curiosity is like a parasitic infestation.</p>

<p>On 2/7/07, you wrote one word.</p>

<p>What was the word?</p>

<p>You know, I wish I had an exciting answer for that, but there are only two boring answers:</p>

<p>1) I don't know.</p>

<p>2) It's net words, so I probably added some and deleted some that day.</p>

<p>So let's just say it was "the".</p>

<p>Ok, that's good. I was actually asking that question as a test. If you'd known, I would finally have proof of the theory extrapolated from susan's comment up there, that you've been replaced by a superhuman writing machine.</p>

<p>Which, you know. Singularity, so that's good. But on the other hand, I'd have missed the fallible Go opponent ;)</p>

<p>The fact that a post- and superhuman writing machine might still lose to you at Go exemplifies pretty well one of my major critiques of the notion of the Singularity.</p>
