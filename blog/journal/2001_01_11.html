<p>Hello, faithful readers.
<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hilarymoonmurphy/index.html">Hilary</a>
for her flattering <a href="http://www.geocities.com/hilarymoonmurphy/2001-0108.html">coverage</a>
of my mini-Dare. Moan all you like about your hit count, Hilary. I love
your journal. It's getting funnier and funnier -- when it's not touching
and scary, like your Open Letter to Cassie.
<p>Now, what Hilary perhaps doesn't realize is that having Aviva on my
arm while I do my Dare is not a handicap -- it's my secret weapon. It's
hard to give in to the demons of self-doubt when the most beautiful creature
in the world is sleeping against your chest, holding onto you as if you
were the only source of warmth, stability and love anyone could ever need.
I expect when she's one like Cassie and expecting me to fetch toys, it'll
be a different story, but for now, I think Aviva is my muse (since Hilary's
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/hilarymoonmurphy/ganesh.gif">Ganpati-Baba</a>
is so cool, I have been wondering when I get a muse. Duh!)&nbsp;
<p>Aviva the Little Goat-Girl (because she says "Meh! Me-ehh!") -- don't
leave reality without her.

<p>Yep: I did it. "A Siege of Cranes" is finished, clocking in at a hefty
10,700 words. It's the longest thing I've ever finished. That's a novella,
right? Did I just write a novella? Or is it just a novelet? Maybe novellas
are 15,000+? Well, it felt like a lot anyway.
<p>I think on sometime Monday the major plot details came to me, and after
that it was gravy. Marish, the hero, was one of those characters who just
talks in your head -- you think you have an idea what the next sentence
out of his mouth is going to be, but then he says something entirely different,
which you can only gleefully write down (just like Web Rat <a href="http://members.home.net/ksumnersmith/index.html">Karina</a>'s
character <a href="http://members.home.net/ksumnersmith/jan0301.html">Arna</a>).
I stole many of the cultural, magical and backstory details from the work
<a href="http://www.leemoyer.com">Lee
Moyer</a> and I (as well as Jamey Harvey, Ethan Ham, John Mueller, Matt
Hulan, Walt Carter and others) did on <a href="http://www.digitaladdiction.com">Sanctum</a>,
messing with them as I saw fit (so that <u>Sanctum</u> purists, if any
ever read it, will surely throw up their hands in dismay -- "No! no! Humans
are the House of <i>War</i>!") ... and the rest of the plot was just precisely
the kind of thing Jamey and Ramin Ackert and I spent our entire adolescence
dropping on each other in innumerable <a href="http://www.chaosium.com">roleplaying</a>
campaigns.
<p>In other words, I'm not sure I can repeat this level of production on
something with more literary pretensions. This was a pure swashbuckling
romp. (Or as close as I can get to a pure swashbuckling romp. Some literary
pretension did creep in. This <i>is</i> me we're talking about, after all.)
<p>Still, I'm taking the fact that I managed to knock this mini-Dare out
of the ballpark as strong evidence in favor of the "ride the wave" or "write
the first draft with the door closed" theory. I followed the <a href="http://www.stephenking.com">Stephen
King</a> recipe (from his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0684853523/qid=979252758/sr=2-1/ref=sc_b_1/102-5751773-2856165">On
Writing</a>) of starting while inspired and not distracting yourself with
anything else -- not showing it to your wife, not revising, not dabbling
with another story, not taking a day off from it -- to which I added not
eating, sleeping, working at the day job, or bathing -- until the sucker
is done. Now I'm putting it aside for a little while; then I'll run through
it for consistency, clarity, verboseness, confusing bits and infelicities
of expression (but not contemplate major plot or character changes unless
I absolutely can't help it). Then I'll send it to the RMCrit online writing
group -- if I can get anyone to read a 10,700 word whale, that is.
<p>One problem I know already: the title has absolutely nothing to do with
the story. But it's such a cool title! Sigh.
