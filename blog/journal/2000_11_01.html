<p>Hope everyone had a sufficiently disturbing, unsettling and unnerving
Halloween.Or whatever.&nbsp;
<p>It's actually rather disturbing just to see Halloween stuff in the stores
here in Switzerland -- part of the creeping Americanization of everything.
Not that I don't like American stuff, I do, actually Halloween is one of
my favorite holidays... but the creeping Anyplace-ization of Everywhere
would be disturbing, if only because it's a homogenization. It's nice for
places to be different. But here at the start of what so far is the second
American Century, Americanization is hard to avoid: this year in Basel,
it's the jack-o-lanterns and pumpkins in every shop. And I figure Thanksgiving
is coming here next.
<p>In keeping with my last entry's theme of my loudly proclaiming I'm not
interested in something and then immediately getting interested in it,
I have been really wanting to do research. I have been thinking a lot (ok,
surfing a lot) about the Emperor Ashoka and Razziya, two figures from Indian
history. Maybe I should do a historical novel? (Or am I nuts?)
<p>Critiques have begun trickling back in on "Corporate Anthropology."
So far they're very helpful; I'm impressed with the level of critiquing
of the RMCrit group. More on the specifics of revising "Corporate Anthropology"
later.
