<p>I got my first <a href="http://www.tangentonline.com/reviews/magazine.php3?review=261">review</a>
the other day, for "The Ant King", and I'm quite pleased with it. Gordon
Van Gelder, that prince among editors, mailed it to me and the other writers
involved, which was very nice of him. The reviewer got what I was up to,
I think, and he liked it. That makes me happy.
<p>I am dictating this with Dragon NaturallySpeaking, having written it
down earlier (or, if you prefer, I am writing this down, planning to dictate
it later). This program is amazing: after two days of training, I can speak
normally and at a pretty fast clip, and it transcribes almost everything
correctly. I'm trying to ease the load on my hands: with programming, writing,
and rugby, I use my hands intensively for almost everything I do -- I don't
want to wear them out.
<p>I finished "Droplet" and sent it to RMCrit. No responses yet. What is
strange story that was. Some things I still really like about it, but the
end got ugly -- even quite unpleasant. I didn't plan this, but the constraints
and games that the beginning of the story set up ended up demanding a violent
resolution. It's also way too long for the anthology whose requirements
inspired it. Will see what RMCrit says -- I'm not even sure if I want them
to love it or trash it. Confusing.

<p>Aviva giggles, grabs accurately, and chews on everything in the world.
She basically wants to eat everything -- balls, rags, rattles, people,
Cadillacs, trees, the moon -- and is convinced that if she can open her
mouth wide enough and pull them toward it, she can manage. She's gotten
heavy, too! We had a newborn over last night and the comparison was fascinating
-- Aviva has at least doubled in size.&nbsp;
<p>And now for the pictures:

<p>One of the wonderful things about where we live is that it's a real
neighborhood. Aviva has her own friends already -- three kids from next
door, <a href="aviva/AvivaAndArta01.jpg">Arta</a>, Amire, and Amir, who
come over to <a href="aviva/AvivaAndArta02.jpg">see her </a>all the time.
They ring the doorbell and say, "Is Aviva home?" just as if they were picking
her up for a soccer game. (I always have to check and see that she is in
fact still a baby, and I haven't missed five or six years somehow).&nbsp;
<p>On April Fool's Day, the first sunny day of the year, we went outside
to sit in the garden in front of our house (the one with the <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/2001/20010416/gardener_betrayed.shtml">roses</a>).
The kids came over to play April Fool's Day jokes on us ("April april!",
they said after they had suckered us) and to play with Aviva. Our friends
<a href="CarolineAndPatrick.jpg">Caroline
and Patrick</a> happened to ride by on their bicycles and <a href="SunnyAprilFirst01.jpg">we
had lunch</a>. It was like a <a href="SunnyAprilFirst02.jpg">spontaneous
block party</a>. I love Basel.

<p>A non-writing goal for this summer: I want to be able to do 20 pull-ups
in a row again, by the end of Clarion. They've got a gym.
