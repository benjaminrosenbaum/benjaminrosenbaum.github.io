<p>Okay, this journal seems to be sliding into being a quarterly...
<p>I have been spending way too much time on the <a href="https://www.rumormill.org">Rumor
Mill</a> lately, time that a good Web Rat would have spent journaling!
Many are the impromptu essays I have deposited there, the flamewars I have
sometimes fanned, sometimes mediated; on <a href="https://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=485">race
and writing</a>, on <a href="https://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=484">measuring
online circulation</a>, on the <a href="https://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=459">worth
of nonpaying e-zines</a>, and so forth.... a lovely online writing community,
but also a big time sink.
<p>Speaking of which, the Rumor Mill has opened forums for its subscribers,
so I've decided to use the <a href="https://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=682">Benjamin
Rosenbaum forum</a> as the guestbook/feedback zone/etc.for this site. Leave
a message!

<p>Various writing news:
<p><a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020218/zvlotsk.shtml">Zvlotsk</a>
and <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/2002/20020318/pernch.shtml">New<sup>(n)</sup>
Pernch</a> of the "Other Cities" are up. Zvlotsk is one of my favorites
of the series. I crack me up.
<p>"The Orange" is scheduled for the Spring/Summer 2002 issue of <a href="https://www.webdelsol.com/Quarterly_West/">Quarterly
West</a>.
<p>"Droplet" is scheduled for the July 2002 issue of <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a>.
<p>Weird Tales rejected "The White City", saying it was a good outline
for a story which needed to be fleshed out. I therefore cut it down by
another 100 words, making it into flash fiction, and sold it to <a href="https://www.vestalreview.net">Vestal
Review</a>. I think this is a good example of how to receive a critique.
Too often I try to slavishly follow the letter of a critique, rather than
attending to the issues that sparked the critique and allowing other, unexpected
solutions to show up.
<p>It is <a href="https://www.vestalreview.net/whitecity.htm">now up</a>
in the April issue of Vestal Review.
<p><a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange Horizons</a> was deemed
<a href="https://www.sfwa.org">SFWA</a>
pro, so I should be an active member of SFWA whenever they process my application.
<p>"Embracing-the-New" bounced from Playboy and is back on my revision
stack. I fear I've over-revised both that and "Red Leather Tassels" and
I'm going to go back and compare them to the original, raw first drafts.
A couple of years ago -- when I was struggling with "The Ant King", for
instance -- somebody would suggest a major revision and I'd be deer-in-headlights
frozen, terrified to touch the story for fear of it collapsing. Now I'm
almost too facile with revision -- you want it, you got it -- a kind of
literary short-order cookery. But I think often the effect of solving lots
of small problems, answering many questions and clearing up many small
confusions, making everything neat and tidy and complete, is that it sucks
the energy out of the story. All the little fixes thwart the raw momentum
that the oiriginal had.
<p>Ellen rejected "On the Cliff by the River" saying she liked it, but
it wasn't for her, and I should probably try it on Strange Horizons or
<a href="https://www.lcrw.net/lcrw/">Lady
Churchill's Rosebud Wristlet </a>-- too weird for the majors, in other
words. As I am a stubborn fellow, and Gordon's so quick to respond, I sent
it to F&amp;SF anyway, but alas, she was right. So I'll probably follow
her advice next.Or possibly try The Third Alternative.&nbsp;
<p>With <a href="https://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/">Charlie Finlay</a>'s
excellent help, I have added an easing-in frame tale and some more action
to "The Book of Jashar", and de-Biblified the language to the point that
it hopefully <i>feels </i>like reading the Bible without reminding people
why they <i>don't</i> read the Bible. It's out to <a href="https://www.scifi.com/scifiction">SCIFI.COM</a>.
<p>Ramin and I did a final outline for <i>Crimp</i>, and I wrote a couple
of chapters before my friend Ethan came to visit; since then I've been
bogged down with one thing and another. I fear that the outline itself
is generating some resistance in me -- as Octavia Butler warned, having
an outline feels like being done with the book. But I think once I sit
down and get my hands dirty with the book, it will come alive again. The
problem is just finding long uninterrupted blocks of time - revising is
much easier to do in snatches.
<p>If you're in NYC, LA, or Chicago, go see Ramin (a.k.a. David Ackert)'s
movie Maryam! It's great. More info <a href="https://www.davidackert.com">here</a>.&nbsp;
<p>Writing buddies of mine are splashing onto covers everywhere: <a href="https://www.sff.net/people/hmm/">Hilary</a>'s
story is on a Realms of Fantasy cover (I haven't seen it yet, but their
covers run to chainmail bikinis.... funny, there were no chainmail bikinis
in that story as I recall it...), and <a href="https://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/">Charlie</a>'s
story is on the cover of the April <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a>
(I just got the <i>March</i> F&amp;SF... dagblasted transatlantic mail.)

<p>My relatively-new-uncle Drew is very sick. He has liver cancer on top
of having just lost his kidneys (and gotten a new one from my heroic aunt
Judy). He seems to be doing a little better after many dramatic and frightening
interventions, but he's far from out of the woods. If you happen to have
room left over in your prayers, please squeeze them in.

<p>I've been meaning to post something here on politics, ever since the
period where <a href="https://www.sff.net/people/hmm/2002-0202.htp">Hilary</a>
and Karina other WebRats were talking about the war. You remember -- that
war America is currently waging. The oddest thing about the war for me
at the moment is that it doesn't feel like we're at war. Of course, I live
in Switzerland, and Switzerland isn't at war. But I also spend a lot of
time emailing and bulletinboarding and talking on the phone to people in
America, and it doesn't come up much. The horrific fighting in Israel seems
much more present to me. Has everyone in America settled down and forgotten
about the war? Is it on the back burner, a political thing people feel
they should think about more but don't really, like trade policy with China?
<p>I am somewhat loath to go into politics here (we're all having such
a nice time, aren't we), so I will <a href="../journal/political_rant.html">ensconce</a>
my rant on a different page. Feel free to skip down to the Aviva pictures.

<p>We went to Lyon with Ethan. Oddly we have no pictures of Ethan in Lyon.
Probably because we are all too obsessed with Aviva:&nbsp;&nbsp;

</a> &nbsp; <a href="../journal/aviva/InLyon02.JPG">3</a> &nbsp; 
<a href="../journal/aviva/InLyon03.JPG">4</a>
<p>And we went to <a href="../journal/pics/Brobdingnag.JPG">Brobdingnag</a>
as well. And to the Nikki de Sant Phalle <a href="../journal/pics/nana.JPG">exhibition</a>.
And to <a href="../journal/pics/rugbyOutfit.JPG">my</a> &nbsp;

<p>Aviva used to be fascinated and excited by No. She'd lean forward to
chomp down on the grit-covered swings in the park across from our house
and you'd be like, "No!" and she'd turn back to you with eyes of gleeful
amazement that said -- No! I know what that means! That means I'm <i>not
allowed</i> to do that! Is that cool or what!? -- and then lean forward
towards the swings, mouth open, just so she could hear No again.
<p>(Well, actually, it's usually not No, it's "Nei!", the Swiss German
version).
<p>Those days are past. Aviva knows what No means and she Doesn't Like
It. No is a Violation of her Civil Rights. If she hears No she lunges for
the swings (or whatever) all the quicker, and snatching her away will bring
cries of appalled rage. Distraction and coaxing work better to temporarily
distract her, but not for long. She has her own mind now, and a will of
iron, my girl.

<p><img SRC="../journal/sep.gif" height=31 width=50></center>

<p>Some of her Daddy's names for her, the indignity of which Aviva gracefully
endures:
<blockquote><tt>Viva</tt>
<br><tt>Veev</tt>
<br><tt>Voov</tt>
<br><tt>Veevle</tt>
<br><tt>Voovle</tt>
<br><tt>Voovster</tt>
<br><tt>D.J. Vivalicious</tt>
<br><tt>Vivatron</tt>
<br><tt>Wiggle</tt>
<br><tt>Wig</tt>
<br><tt>the Wiggle</tt>
<br><tt>WiggleWorm</tt>
<br><tt>AvivaDiva</tt></blockquote>
Esther claims that Aviva calls herself "WaWa". She says Aviva says it to
indicate possession, pointing at something and saying, "WaWa!", and also
to talk to herself in the mirror. Esther always distinguishes new words
the Vivatron says well before I do. It's hard, because what Aviva actually
says to the mirror is more like "Washtoabla Abelo ma'a'awaghrrr na''a'w-bl-bl-bl-bl
WaWa zhrgauumawaaaaaa!" (If anyone knows what this means, please email
me.)
<p>Other current suspected words the Veevster says:
<blockquote><tt>MaMa (Mommy)</tt>
<br><tt>MamMa (banana)</tt>
<br><tt>DaDa (Daddy)</tt>
<br><tt>Na (No)</tt>
<br><tt>Na na na na (Really no)</tt>
<br><tt>Na na na na (I know you're about to tell me "No", but stuff it)</tt>
<br><tt>Abe (downwards)</tt>
<br><tt>Ba (ball)</tt>
<br><tt>Ba (bear)</tt>
<br><tt>BaBeh (Baby)</tt>
<br><tt>Abelo (we don't know what this means, but she says it a lot)</tt>
<br><tt>AhhOh (Hello)</tt>
<br><tt>Nh! Nh! (I want something)</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>She understands most questions -- particularly about her preferences
-- and nods or shakes her head very confidently, precisely, and seriously
to them.
<p>Abelo!
