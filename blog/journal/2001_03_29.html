<p>Wow, despite the TWENTY-ONE pictures of Aviva in my <a href="2001_03_06.html">last
posting</a>, <i>some </i>people still aren't satisfied. Hmph! I probably
should have spaced them out over several entries. No, you don't get any
new pictures of Aviva today, I'm writing on the train and my digital camera
is at home. So there. Just be good and pretend you're paying attention
anyway.
<p>The Little Weasel can find her hands consistently now, she is starting
to look at things and grab for them, and she babbles her head off constantly.
Her love affair with <a href="aviva/RaeggiBonboAviva2.jpg">Bonbo the dragon</a>,
who hangs over her changing table, seems to be over; they're still good
friends, and she will regard him calmly as he bobs up and down above her
and occasionally direct some comment at him, like "Auuwughh", but the windmilling,
thrashing, caterwauling passion that used to imbue their relationship is
gone. She is more and more interested, however, in the <a href="aviva/BizarreToy2.jpg">bizarre
toy.</a> She can grab, maul and masticate it, unlike Bonbo who remains
out of reach, and that's just where she is as a person right now, okay?&nbsp;
<p>This condition of parenthood, of observing the forward rush of time
through the bright and accelerated life of your child as they grow in and
out of things, gain and lose them, is new to me, and makes me happy and
sad at the same time.
<p>The other day we were lying on the couch and Aviva was pounding on my
face with her little fists -- whomp, whomp, whomp -- and she's getting
pretty strong, you know -- and I had this reaction like, how do I explain
that this might be a little too hard to be pounding on Daddy's face? But
of course, I thought, that comes later, that whole What You Should And
Shouldn't Do and How Much Is Too Much and all that. And it occurred to
me that Aviva is still in the Garden of&nbsp; Eden; she hasn't eaten from
the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. There is no ounce of hesitation
or shame or calculation or chagrin in her; there is only whatever there
is before her right now, textures under her hands, light from the window,
faces and shapes, things to feel and pound on.&nbsp;
<p>I think she does have pride, though, in the sense of pride in accomplishment.
If you lift her up under her arms she can actually stand, bearing basically
her whole weight on her legs (as long as you provide the missing sense
of balance), and she's got this look of confidence and pride as she bobs
her head slightly back and forth, and gestures with her arms, like, look!
ha ha! I'm standing!

<p>Since I'm on the subject of people pounding on my face anyway, I might
as well tell this rugby story, since it's a milestone of a sort. Also,
I really like those online journals, like <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/diana/">Diana</a>'s,
that allow a window into another life. Diana is a cop and it's always fascinating
to read her <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/diana/2001/021501.htm">stories
of the beat</a>. So perhaps this might entertain in the same fashion, since
not everyone is masochistic enough to be on a rugby team. Plus, it may
be interesting for those of you writing fight scenes.
<p>Up until the weekend before last, I hadn't been in any real fights in
my life. A couple of times I've had to restrain someone physically to get
them to calm down or something like that, and I used to wrestle and spar
in various martial arts courses, but I had never actually had someone punching
me trying to hurt me before.
<p>Anyway, a fight broke out on the sidelines right next to where I was
standing. Now, the week before, after a particularly pugnacious and lousy
game with Yverdon in which the rucks kept degenerating into wrestling matches
with punching and kicking (and me yelling from the sidelines, "Yo! If I
wanted to watch World Wide Wrestling, I could've stayed at home!"), we
of the Basel team had had an argument about what you should do if you see
your teammates getting pounded on -- get involved? Stand back and wait
for it to be over? I had suggested the thing to do was to go in to break
it up, making your peaceful intentions clear. I was told this would just
get me punched, to which I had stubbornly replied, "Well, I'll do it anyway."&nbsp;
<p>Now, feeling sort of obligated to follow up on my expressed intention,
I rushed over to the fight. But how exactly do you break up a fight? If
you pull your guy off, the other guy will just keep punching him, which
seems counterproductive. If you pull the other guy off, that's even worse,
as it looks like you are holding him for your guy to punch, which will
invite further reinforcements from his side, escalating the situation.
Ideally one peacemaker from each team would pull his own guy off, with
the combatants being separated in a single, coordinated motion. I wasn't
quite sure how to arrange this, however, so I just stepped between them,
trying to speak soothingly and placing my hands on their shoulders.
<p>It's actually pretty difficult to step between two guys who are fighting.
I had to stop and then shoulder my way in, like getting on board one of
those Japanese subway cars where they have paid professionals who squeeze
one more passenger in before the car departs. At this point, I ended up
facing the Albaladejo (that was the other team) player, a young French-Swiss
fellow with about a third of a meter and 20 kilos on me, looking about
as angry as anyone I ever saw. He spent the next couple of seconds punching,
kicking and head-butting me while I was trying to get ahold of his arms
to make him stop. At that point another Albaledejo player pulled me off,
making soothing sounds to calm me down, which I thought was pretty funny.
<p>Here are my observations on this brief interlude of physical combat:
<ul>
<li>
You know how in cartoons a fight is often represented as a cloud with hands,
feet, stars, squiggles, and exclamation points coming out at random points?
And you know how in the movies, you see Jet Li or Jackie Chan's every artful
blow and parry, and it's like an exciting, well choreographed dance?&nbsp;
Well, the cartoon representation is much more phenomenologically accurate,
at least for my skill level. There is too much physical information too
quickly for your brain to process, so it actually seems very abstract,
more like a cloud with exclamation points coming out of it than anything
else.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
It didn't really hurt. That was the most surprising thing. Given the apparently
phenomenal amount of blows this guy was able to land (he head-butted me
at least three times, for instance), and his size, why wasn't he able to
do more damage? I didn't even have a headache afterwards. I had a slight
bruise above my eyebrow, and my knee hurt that evening -- but that may
have been from diving on the ball later, when I did finally get into the
game. Really, receiving an average tackle is much more painful than getting
pounded on by some big guy trying to hurt you. Was this guy just particularly
incompetent, or is unarmed combat by untrained folk just a really inefficient
process? I tend to think the latter. This comes as quite a revelation,
I can tell you.</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
I wasn't moved at all to hit this guy back. That was another surprise.
It's not that I'm a pacifist - I think there are valid reasons to use violence.
I mean, if this guy was trying to hurt Aviva, I'd shoot him if I thought
that was necessary to stop him. It's just that the fact that he was hitting
me, by itself, didn't seem like a good reason to hit him. I was, after
all, trying to stop the fight, not escalate it, so hitting him didn't seem
constructive. That sounds merely logical, but I kind of imagined that,
when actually being beaten on, I might be overcome with anger and the need
to strike back. But I was quite calm; I was thinking, "Dude, like, what's
your problem?" and "How do you say 'break up a fight' in French?"</li>

<br>&nbsp;
<li>
I was elated afterwards. After living the past thirty-one years attached
to glands that daily pump me full of testosterone (a chemical designed,
as far as I can tell, to build muscle, increase aggression, and interfere
with rational thought), but too civilized and self-righteously moral to
do anything about it, there's something really wonderful about being in
a nice cathartic brawl. Even if it was me standing there looking silly
while this big guy whaled on me. I had been rather depressed about being
stuck on the bench, beforehand, but afterwards I was like "Woo-hoo! Now
I'm ready to play!"</li>
</ul>
So yes, it was just like in <a href="http://www.popmatters.com/film/fight-club.html">Fight
Club</a>.
<p>All right, now that my parents are probably worried out of their minds,
let me state for the record that I'm not planning to get in any more of
these. Next time I'm going to round up some assistance and do the pulling
the combatants off of each other thing, rather than the stick my head in
between them thing. (Or just let them go at it, if it's a fair fight: that
may be one of those unwritten rules of boy etiquette that I never quite
mastered.)
<p>Still, it was good research.

<p>I put the revision of "A Siege of Cranes" on hold to work on "Crimp",
the horror novel I'm writing with my friend Ramin. I've been stuck on Crimp
and avoiding it. I was excited about what Ramin was doing with the plotline
he was working on, and totally stifled and bored with what I was doing
with my bit. Finally it occurred to me to talk Ramin into switching. This
is the great thing you can do when you're collaborating. Now he's stuck
with the boring, mystical Collectors, and I got to write 3000 words of
action-packed horror in the Steve and Nurit plotline. Whee!&nbsp; I'm wandering
away from our plot outline, which is great; it feels alive again. I have
no idea if this book will ever come together or what it will end up looking
like, frankly, but I'm learning a lot just attempting something novel-sized.
