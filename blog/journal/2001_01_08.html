<p>Check it out -- my second ever sale -- to <a href="http://www.novalearn.com/wol">Writer
Online</a>. I tinkered a little with a prose poem I wrote in 1999, "The
Duck", mostly reformatting it so it looked more like a story and making
the narrative flow a little clearer, and emailed it to them Friday. Yesterday
I got their reply, which reads in part:
<br>&nbsp;

<td><tt>Dear Benjamin Rosenbaum,</tt>
<p><tt>What a wonderful story!&nbsp; I can pay you 10 cents a word</tt>
<br><tt>for First North American Serial Rights; the story will</tt>
<br><tt>be published in our end-of-January issue....Your story is</tt>
<br><tt>unforgettable, and I look forward to publishing it in</tt>
<br><tt>Writer Online.</tt></td>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? Ten cents a word is a great price for genre fiction,
almost twice what <a href="http://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a> pays newbies.
<br>Of course, at a whopping 194 words, that's only $19.40. And this is
the very webzine whose circulation claim I cast aspersions on in my last
entry. Still, I must say that the thought that "The Duck" will be arriving
in 35,000 inboxes is quite pleasant... even if many of the inboxes' owners
do just hit "delete".&nbsp;
<p>I must thank those who helped me revise it, particularly <a href="http://www.wheatley.ch">Neil
Wheatley</a>, who insisted that imagining licking a duck's flippers was
just a little too kinky...

<p>I finally also got the rejection of "The White City", from David Truesdale
at <a href="http://www.blackgate.com">Black Gate</a>, who writes:

<br><tt>consider sending our way. The editor tells me we are in particular
need of colorful,action-adventure sword &amp; sorcery tales, being well
stocked on most other types of fantasy.</tt></td>

<p>Colorful, action-adventure sword &amp; sorcery tales, huh? My first
reaction was, shucks, that's not what I write. My second reaction was,
who says? I've played Runequest (and Dungeons &amp; Dragons, and Warhammer,
and DragonQuest, and The Fantasy Trip, and...)&nbsp; for, what, 22 years
now? I grew up reading Sword &amp; Sorcery -- well, more the 60's New Wave
send-ups of and homages to and deconstructions of Sword &amp; Sorcery,
from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0441203981/sr=2-1/ref=sc_b_1/102-5751773-2856165">Elric
of Melnibone</a> to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/102-5751773-2856165">Neveryona</a>.
I co-designed an award-winning Internet game set in a partly Sword &amp;
Sorcery (and partly high fantasy) universe. Who says I can't write colorful,
action-adventure sword &amp; sorcery? I oughta be able to crank that shit
out like nobody's business.
<p>So, inspired by the WebRats Darers, I've decided to do a mini-dare for
the last week of my "paternity leave" vacation (I've more or less adapted
to the sleep deprivation, and I've noticed to my great glee that I can
actually type one-handed with Aviva on my lap and we're both very happy
about the arrangement). I figure a good S&amp;S yarn should be between
six and ten thousand words, so I've set myself a goal of 2000 words a day
until its done.
<p>But wait, I hear you say. Weren't you just complaining about how you
have too many stories started -- too many pots on the stove? What's up
with you starting yet another one? Well, yes, but now I have this <a href="2001_01_05.html">new
model </a>about "writing with the door closed", riding the white-hot wave
of inspiration, momentum, etc. The problem with "The Problem With Danny"
and with Amra is that I've put them down too long -- the ashes in the fireplace
are cold. That doesn't mean they're dead -- I may come back to them --
but it means it's no easier to finish them now than it will be in a month
or two. In fact it may be <i>harder</i> -- I'm still distracted by trying
to recapture what I was trying to say earlier and only half-remember. The
best thing is to just leave them in my notebook for when I either have
a flash of inspiration about them, or for later when I can read them fresh
and create something wholly new. This has worked before -- "The Ant King"
started as a bizarre one-page fragment that lay in my notebook for weeks,
if not months, before I picked it up again. The problem isn't picking stuff
up again; it's trying to force myself to finish a particular project that's
gone cold.
<p>So, 2000 words a day. That's a lot; I've written a good deal more sometimes
when I was particularly inspired -- "The Ant King" is 6,000 words, and
after picking it up again I finished it in one sitting -- but I've never
tried to anything close as a planned, daily routine. So far, I haven't
managed: I set the goal for myself Saturday evening, and I wrote 1000 words
on Saturday and 700 on Sunday. Still, this is a very high level of production
for me, so I can't complain much. We'll see how I do today.
<p>So far it's called "A Siege of Cranes" (which is actually the animal
group name for cranes -- doesn't that rock?), though I have no idea how
the cranes fit in, if at all. It's a lark, though. I'm stealing liberally
from the backstory I wrote for <a href="http://www.digitaladdiction.com">Sanctum</a>,
a technique I learned from Sanctum's artist (and my main backstory co-creator
for that game), <a href="http://www.leemoyer.com">Lee Moyer</a>, who happily
pulls an image from one of his works, spins and morphs it and sticks it
in another -- which saves time, creates continuity, and acts as a kind
of ironic web of self-reference inside his <i>oeuvre</i> (my god, did I
really just say that? I am <i>sooooooo</i> pretentious!)&nbsp; Mainly it
saves time, though. <tt>;-></tt>

<p>Also got a fast-turnaround rejection for "Susie", another poem-turned-flash-fiction-story,
from <a href="http://www.vestalreview.net">Vestal Review</a>, and sent
"The White City" off to the Glimmer Train Very Short Fiction Contest (where
I don't think it has a prayer, but what do I know? It is very short, at
least).
