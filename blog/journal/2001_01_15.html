<p>My first day back to work after a month of "paternity leave". It went
okay. I like my day job, it's interesting enough, the people are great
and the <a href="https://www.comit.ch">company</a> is very generous -- and
it's only 34 hours a week. However, I'd still much rather be home writing
stories and snuggling with <a href="EstherRegardsAviva.jpg">Esther</a>
and <a href="AvivaMeditates.jpg">Aviva</a>.

<p><a href="https://members.aol.com/heytrey">Trey</a> is now also talking
to his characters -- or they are talking to him. As I was talking about
doing in my last entry. As <a href="https://tbooker.home.sprynet.com/jan1001.html">Marti</a>
and <a href="https://members.home.net/ksumnersmith/jan0301.html">Karina</a>
have recently reported doing. It's catchy.
<p>Why do so many fiction writers report this phenomenon? Why do we get
all gleeful and awed and say things like "Gosh, I know this sounds really
weird, but I didn't write that scene -- the characters talked to me!" The
non-writer is left thinking that either
<ul>
<li>
we are just lying, or</li>

<li>
this is a cheesy, affected way of describing something probably much less
interesting, or</li>

<li>
we are teetering on the edge of full-blown schizophrenic delusions.</li>
</ul>
But it doesn't feel to us like we are exaggerating, or nuts. It seems like
our characters talk inside our heads, which seems bizarre and miraculous,
and at the same time perfectly straightforward and normal.
<p>So here's my theory. If hearing a (pseudo-)scientific hypothesis about
this is going to ruin your enjoyment of and wonder at it, stop reading
now.
<p>What I reckon is going on here is that there are two parts of your brain
at issue, both evolved over millions of years of mammalian history. (Note
that I don't necessary mean physical, contiguous parts of the brain --
they could be mechanisms distributed over the whole brain, or whatever.
I'm not a neuroscientist.) One is the part that tells lies. This is a more
or less analytical part, which figures things out. It says, well, they
can't prove I stole this banana if there are multiple available suspects
whose motives seem equally strong. This is the part we often begin writing
stories with: the part that tells elaborate falsehoods, woven out of half-truths,
exaggerations and outrageous improbable leaps, some arising randomly out
of the soup of creativity, but all carefully marshaled into a well-planned
lie.&nbsp;
<p>Then there's another part of our brain that simulates for us the personalities
of those we know well, particularly those close to us. Since it is a big
selection advantage, among mammals as social as we are, to have a very
accurate model of those around us -- mostly so as to figure out what we
can get away with -- I think we devote a lot of space and processing power
to this. So much so, that we don't receive results from this part through
the narrow tube of discursive logic; we don't think, given that Sally tends
toward anger, and that this is a mid-level provocation, Sally will probably
be mad enough to speak loudly, but not to strike. Rather, we receive our
model of Sally's reactions broadband, through intuition -- they spring
up inside us as if from nowhere.
<p>To test this hypothesis, imagine that you have just done something that
you know will piss off your lover or roommate or parents -- like missed
the last train, or flooded the bathroom, or used the metal spatula with
the Teflon pan -- something they'll be mad at and you'll be defensive about.
Better yet, think back to the last time you were in such a predicament.
Can't you <i>hear</i> what they're going to say, and your defense, and
their response to the defense, and so on -- don't you live the whole fight
in your head even before they or you get home and you have to face the
music? In fact, doesn't the whole fight play itself out unbidden to your
mind, even if you don't really want to rehearse it? That's the part of
your brain I'm talking about.
<p>So I think what happens when your characters talk to you is this: you
have spent long enough brooding on them, fiddling with them, and telling
thought-out lies about them, that you have <i>tricked your brain into believing
they exist</i>. Your brain is now allocating resources to modeling "what
they would do", the same resources it uses for your real-life friends and
enemies, and delivering the results broadband, though your intuition.&nbsp;
(It's analogous to the moment of achieving fluency in a foreign language,
when speaking and listening suddenly stop being a grueling exercise in
conscious decoding and start being instantaneous, just you talking and
listening 'as usual' -- you have managed to move the foreign language around
in your brain, from fact memory to tool memory).
<p>Frankly, if that is the way it works, I think it's pretty cool. It doesn't
make the moment of the character speaking less magical for me -- on the
contrary, I feel awed by what amazing things our brains are. It's another
layer of magic, under the layer of Marish somehow speaking to me out of
the vortex of Storyland.
<p>Gentle Reader, do you agree? Have you personally experienced this phenomenon?
Do you have another theory? Do you think we're just nuts? <a href="mailto:ben@digitaladdiction.com">Let
me know</a>, and I promise to give competing theories airtime here on The
Benjamin Channel.

<p>I have decided to use "The Ant King" and "Baby Love" as my application
stories for <a href="https://www.geocities.com/SoHo/Exhibit/6240/clarion.html">Clarion
East</a>. The first is a no-brainer, given that I sold it to <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a><i>
and</i> it's quirky and surreal. The second, though, feels riskier, since
I just wrote it. But I like it -- it's short but punchy, I think -- and
it contrasts well with "The Ant King", since "Baby Love" is more traditional,
straight-up "what if?" science fiction. It's speculative fiction in the
strict sense, which "The Ant King" isn't really. (The "what if?" question
in "The Ant King" is "what if Ben wrote down some really weird shit?")
<p>So I am eagerly awaiting the rest of the critiques of "Baby Love" from
the RMCrit online writer's group. I got four back so far, mostly positive
(a more positive response, so far, than I got with "Corporate Anthropology",
which I am relieved about) and with a lot of helpful suggestions -- particularly
<a href="https://members.aol.com/heytrey">Trey</a>
did a yeoman job of detailed line-by-line commenting (after I pleaded for
more specifics). <a href="https://dawnpasley.faithweb.com/">Dawn</a>'s,
<a href="https://www.geocities.com/terrybramlett/">Terry</a>'s,
and Martin's comments were also quite helpful.
<p>I am also awaiting comments and closure on "Baby Love" so that I can
try to get critiquers for "A Siege of Cranes" -- although I have a few
changes to make on that anyway, from Esther's first reading, and I want
to let it sit for a bit before I tackle it. I'll probably do it Friday.
But will RMCrit be ready for more Rosenbaumiana by Friday? Or have I flooded
the pipeline?&nbsp;
