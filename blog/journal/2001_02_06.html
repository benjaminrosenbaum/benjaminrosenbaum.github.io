<p>My story "The Duck" is up on <a href="https://www.novalearn.com/wol">Writer
Online</a>.
<p>People seem to fall strictly into two camps on this story. There's the
"wow, cool!" camp and the "what the hell were you thinking?" camp. I think
it's an even split so far.
<p>The <a href="https://www.novalearn.com/wol">Writer Online</a> people
seem to be in the first camp. They wrote a glowing intro to the story on
the main page. It's so complimentary it's kind of unnerving.
<p>I was so psyched when I read what they wrote -- this was on Friday --
that I decided short shorts were my new favorite genre. A few hours of
work, and you get such adulation? Granted, strictly measured in terms of
hours of work per word published or dollar earned, novels are probably
the easiest and short shorts the hardest form (<a href="https://www.hatrack.com">Orson
Scott Card</a> makes this point in his <a href="https://www.writersdigest.com/catalog/b_catmain.asp?title=How+to+Write+Science+Fiction+and+Fantasy">How
To Write Science Fiction and Fantasy</a>), but in terms of psychological
ease and instant gratification, they can't be beat! And now that there's
the internet, there are lots of markets for super-short fiction. I decided
to write 20 pieces of flash fiction in the near future -- no deadline,
as I have enough going on this month -- and bought myself a new green notebook
for the purpose. I wrote three on Friday. Two are pretty good, one of which
probably only works as the start to something longer.
<p>I love buying new notebooks. I can wander for hours in stationery stores.
When you're sitting in front of it with high expectations, a blank page
can be a nightmare; but when you're in the store flipping through the blank
pages of a notebook you may buy, they are pure possibility, pure future.
Anything can happen in those pages, and looking at them feels like flying.
The proper notebook should not be too august (or you will be paralyzed
trying to get things right) nor too cheap (or you will write without respecting
what you put down). It should be individual, but not so quirky or garish
as to distract from its contents.&nbsp;

<p>Aviva had a breakthrough today, or at least I noticed it today. She
can now find her hands at will. This is very useful for putting them in
her mouth and sucking on them. What an enormous spike in her control of
her surroundings this must be! Whenever she wants something to gnaw on
-- wait, don't help me -- here we go -- ta da! Look ma, hands!
