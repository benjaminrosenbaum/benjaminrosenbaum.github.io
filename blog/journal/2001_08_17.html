<p>Well... I guess this will conclude my Clarion West journal, although
Clarion's been over for a while. Maybe I will go through my notebooks next
time and do a "What I Learned at Clarion West" roundup. I am the big slacker
of the bunch, as <a href="http://www.rousselle.com/allan">Allan</a>, <a href="http://www.lingthemerciless.com/">Sam</a>,
<a href="http://members.home.net/ksumnersmith/index.html">Karina</a>,
<a href="http://www.prairienet.org/%7Epbrewer/Journal/writing_progress.php">Philip</a>
and <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/%7Etmseay/">Thomas</a> are all done
with their Clarion journals and back to their real lives.
<p>OK, so I'll have to be briefer with the last part of Clarion.
<p>"A Wind Passes Over Him" received mixed reviews. Some people loved the
language, the style and the weirdness of it; others were frustrated by
it being several episodes without any clear connection between them, and
it being so long. I felt like it was not really successful, but there was
a lot of good stuff in there. I'm letting it sit with the rest; I may break
it up into more than one story, ultimately.
<p>I was a little depressed after the critiques of "Utopia on Jellyfish"
and "A Wind Passes Over Him" -- it seemed like I was getting worse, that
the best story so far had been "Embracing-The-New" and I was wandering
downhill fast. It helped that <a href="http://www.goodhair.com/z/images/2_kiini_pic.jpg">Kiini</a>
told me to get over myself -- that in "Utopia", in particular, I was letting
showing off how smart I was get in the way of the story. This was very
useful -- it let me see how to move beyond where I was stuck.
<p>Ellen Datlow, editor of <a href="http://www.scifi.com/scifiction">SciFiction</a>,
was week five. She is a wonderful person, very nice (and yet very New York
-- these can apparently be combined. :-)) and with a deep grasp of the
genre and the industry. It was fascinating to hear things from an editor's
perspective. One gets the sense, too, of how decisive an editor must be:
she made simple decisions about the stories, "that won't work" or "I like
that." She gave us a lot of information about contracts, etiquette, building
the writer-editor relationship and how editors see the business. She suffered
from the lack of real bagels in Seattle.
<p>Week five I wrote a Susan Cooper-inspired urban fantasy. The best thing
about it was the characters: the protagonist is an old woman with senile
dementia who has to decide the world's fate, and everyone in class liked
her. They also liked the cool magic visuals. The worst thing about it is
the plot: it's too spare, and it makes the philosophical dilemma I try
to set up too easy. The resolution satisfied almost no one.
<p>Week six we had Jack Womack, who is very funny, also kind and generous
(this seems to be a theme with the Clarion West instructors -- they were
uniformly gentle with us -- nothing like the hard-ass confrontational approach
I'd read about in stories of Harlan Ellison and Chip Delany teaching Clarion),
and likes zaniness and weird things. His day job is as a publicist (for
Harper-Collins, I think) and he had lots of fascinating information about
how novels are assessed, bought, produced, distributed, pushed, sold to
the public, and reviewed. I was particularly struck by the counterintuitive
way the success of a book is measured. A writer who sells 1,500 copies
of a 3,000 copy print run is better off, oddly, than a writer who sells
10,000 copies of a 30,000 copy print run. Hmm!
<p>I felt like my last story, "What Do We Lack", was the most successful
of all of them. <a href="http://www.sff.net/people/raymund/">Raymund</a>
called it "a domestic drama of the posthuman". It depicts a family crisis
of the Geranium Superbounce Family in the year 2312. In it, it seems to
me I finally solved the problem I'd been wrestling with since "Utopia on
Jellyfish", that of how to give the reader the exposition and backstory
they need, and only what they need, without boring or annoying them or
kicking them out of the story.
<p>During the last few days many of us asked everyone we could to rate
all the stories we'd written, in that person's opinion, from their favorite
to their least favorite (so somebody might give "Nematode Wiggle" a <b>1</b>
if they liked it best among my stories, and "Utopia on Jellyfish" a <b>6
</b>if
they liked it least, and so on). Not everyone played this game, and some
thought it was dumb -- who cares which story people liked best? You just
make them all as good as you can. But I found it extremely useful, mostly
for correcting the misapprehensions I had about the feedback I'd gotten.
For instance, I'd thought that everyone hated "Utopia on Jellyfish" and
loved "What Do We Lack". But no. The ratings were all over the map. Every
single story I wrote was one or two people's favorite, and almost every
story was someone's least favorite. I found that fascinating. Actually,
"What Do We Lack" was no one's absolute least favorite, and it may be this
general adequacy, rather than any quality of excellence in the story, that
made the critique of it seem so positive.
<p>In the last couple of weeks a bunch of us played <a href="pics/sweatie.jpg">basketball</a>
almost daily, and it was a great stress reliever. Future Clarion Westies:
go to the gym and play basketball! It's worth the steep, if inconsistently
applied, $5 entry fee to do something so distinct from writing, that gets
you out of your head and into your body.&nbsp;
<p>I also did end up doing some pull-ups. I got up to nine.

I miss my fellow Clarionites.&nbsp;
<p>I'm very proud of us that we went through Clarion West with such grace
and generosity. Sure, as Allan notes in his journal, there were some tensions
and crises, and times when life intruded -- some of which were, I think,
extremely hard on some people. But in terms of group friction... well,
if that was the dreaded Clarion crucible -- pshaw! It was a lot of work,
and being up against those deadlines could be frustrating and depressing,
and of course people pissed each other off sometimes -- but I've been in
some dysfunctional communities, and man, by comparison CW2k1 was a model
of tolerance and mutual support.
<p>We seem to have a thriving email list, and I expect we'll see each other
somewhere, somehow -- but we'll probably never all be physically <a href="pics/Sarongs.JPG">together</a>
again. Which is sadder than I would think it would be: strangely sad, wondrously
sad.

<p>The <a href="http://www.pedestalmagazine.com">Pedestal</a> rejection
was for "The White City". I'm a little disenchanted with that story, but
it's out again, to an oddly well-paying lit mag called <i>An Affair of
the Mind</i>.&nbsp;
<p>"The Death Trap of Dr. Freezo" is out to <i>Hemispheres</i>, United
Airline's very well paying and well-respected inflight magazine. I don't
know, I think it would be really fun to have all these transatlantic travelers
happen upon it, and read it instead of watching the crappy movie.
<p>Revised "Droplet", clarifying a little and putting back a couple of
things I'd cut to make Mary Anne's word limit, and sent it out to GVG.
I also dropped a hint in the cover letter that if he wants to see a revision
of "A Siege of Cranes" where I try and establish the story's genre earlier,
I'd be game. In the meantime, I'm going to try and fix his concern before
sending it to <i>Realms of Fantasy</i>.&nbsp;
<p>I'm in a cycle of revisions with the <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange
Horizons</a> editors about "Other Cities" -- I'm hoping we'll get done
soon so they can actually buy it. As part of this, I broke out one section
that was a little too real-world and too politically controversial, "The
City of Peace", and made it a separate short-short. I'm going to try it
at <i>Harper's</i>.
<p>I'm thinking of submitting something soon to <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.com">McSweeney's</a>.
It doesn't pay anything -- which violates my usual rule of not giving fiction
away for free -- but they've generated so much buzz that it seems to be
pretty prestigious by now, plus Jack Womack suggested them as a good market
for stylistically experimental stuff, plus they seem like such a fun and
funny bunch of people, who can resist playing with them? And they seem
to be masters at ingenious and wonderful packaging. I've ordered a sample
copy: we'll see if it lives up to the hype. Their website is hilarious,
though.

Here is Aviva at Brown:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="aviva/AtBrown01.jpg">1&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="aviva/InThePark01.jpg">2</a>
<p>Here is Aviva visiting Clarion:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="aviva/AvivaHappy.jpg">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="aviva/DaddysGirl.jpg">2</a>
<p>Aviva crawls, on her elbows and belly, like G.I. Joe. She zips from
room to room, panting with excitement, going over thresholds and through
chairs, aiming for your feet. This is a revolution in her world, let me
tell you. She can go and get whatever she wants! Even when you're holding
her, if she wants some other object or person, she just launches herself
at it. Sometimes she'll launch herself from me to Esther and back again
several times. (With our cooperation, I mean. We don't really let her <i>jump</i>.)
<p>She also eats. She <b>loves</b> eating. This may be because we waited
quite a while -- she was practically 7 months when she had her first bite
of banana mush. So she was already really aware of people eating and eager
to try it herself. She's so into it, she bounces up and down impatiently
while you're refilling the spoon. It's darling.
