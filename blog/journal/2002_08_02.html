<p><b><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light">Thursday, August 1, 2002</font></b>
<p>Hey there. <a href="http://www.vbs.admin.ch/internet/e/vbs/Chef_ao/20000801.htm">Happy
Swiss National Day!</a> <b>Esther and Aviva are out of town</b> and, as
usual in such cases, I stayed up half the night hacking (and missed the
fireworks). I'm just not used to sleeping alone anymore.
<p>Oops, that was yesterday. Now it's Friday already.
<p>I'm going to <b>bold some key words</b> in every paragraph here to <b>make
your skimming easier</b>. No, don't thank me. I'm a prince, I know.
<p>I know I haven't been a very good Web Rat lately, and that this journal
is getting a bit dusty. <b>I've been spending time on the <a href="http://www.rumormill.org">Mill</a></b>
again, doing <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=39&m=5889">research</a>,
talking about <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=232&m=1248">networking</a>
as a writer, <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=441&m=822">Charlotte
Bronte</a>,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=441&m=830">Raymond
Chandler</a>, and&nbsp; <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=441&m=852">Neil
Gaiman</a>, and just being generally <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=682&m=53">silly</a>.&nbsp;
My <a href="http://www.rumormill.org/index.php?t=682">author topic</a>
has a bunch of fun, silly regulars, many of whom arrived in an entourage
surrounding the magnificent <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/">Charlie
Finlay</a>.
<p>But now, predictably, <b>everyone is clamoring</b> for more pictures
of Aviva. I lost my digital camera on a French train, so it's a good thing
that I had intentionally kept back some of the pitctures we had taken before.
So these will be a little out of date. As usual, I will make you suffer
through some writing news and general blather before I let you see the
cute toddler. Heh, heh, heh.&nbsp;

<p>Borders has introduced a <a href="http://afr.com/companies/2002/05/21/FFXS9M4RF1D.html">category
management plan</a> <b>allowing the big publishers more control</b> over
what books get put on the shelves. Bad for authors, bad for readers, and
very, very bad for small presses, the source of much of the innovation
and experimentation and diversity in the book market. Borders, I hear,
controls a quarter of book sales in the USA.
<p>Here is <a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/bulletins/PBD.jsp?articleid=2871">Ralph
Nader's letter</a> opposing the plan, and here is <a href="../letter_to_borders.html">my
letter</a>.&nbsp;
<p>If you also think this is a really, really lame idea, you can <b>email
Borders' CEO</b> <a href="mailto:kbrown@bordersgroupinc.com">Gregory Josefowicz</a>
via his executive assistant, Kathy Brown, and perhaps also <a href="mailto:springle@bordersgroupinc.com">Sherry
Pringle</a> at Investor Relations.&nbsp;

Cities of Myrkhyr</a>, the second-to-last of&nbsp; the "Other Cities" are
up. Only Stin to go and then my year-long run at Strange Horizons will
be over.
<p><b>I got a <i>very </i>flattering <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/07b/fsf132.htm">review</a>
of "Droplet"</b> on SFF.net. Wow! I've heard the review of it in <a href="http://www.locusmag.com">Locus</a>,
the main trade rag for SF/F, is also good, but the short fiction reviews
aren't online there and of course things mailed book rate transatlantically
take forever to get here.
<p>

<b>If you want to read "Droplet"</b>, you can either <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/fsf/backish.htm">snail-order 
a back issue</a> of the July 2002 F&SF as a printed physical object, or 
buy a <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/ebooks/eBook2245.htm">downloadable copy of that issue</a> 
in PDF format at <a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/">fictionwise.com</a>.

<p>I did a whole lot of revising on "Breakfast in Montana", my little <b>Western
short-short </b>(well, it's 2000 words, so that's a relatively meaty short-short,
four times the length of "The White City"). I submitted it to the Very
Short Fiction Award contest at <a href="http://www.glimmertrain.com">Glimmer
Train</a>. This is probably the most-revised thing I ever wrote. It went
through at least 7 drafts and at least 13 critiquers, many of whom critiqued
it in 3 or 4 different versions. Oy va voy. It was an exhausting but also
fun process, and I think it ended up pretty good. I think it's the first
thing I've written that has neither fantastical or speculative content,
nor stylistic pyrotechnics. It's just all about the writing and the characters,
baby. Although I like some authors of <b>mainstream character-centric fiction</b>
of this sort, I'm rarely inspired to write stories like that. I usually
need some neato elements of worldbuilding or style to get me interested
enough to get to the point where I care about the characters enough myself
to write a story for them. (In the case of "Breakfast in Montana", I think
political issues and served that function instead.)

<p>I've noticed that folks can get real riled up about <b>genre borders</b>.
Despite the Zeitgeist dominance of tropes that originated in sci-fi (a
summer blockbuster movie <i>without</i> a science fictional premise is
the oddball), SF as a genre of fiction exploring ideas still sees itself
as an embattled ghetto. No, wait, that's wrong. A certain <i>community
</i>which
has cherished and nurtured SF as a genre of fiction exploring ideas still
sees itself as an embattled ghetto.&nbsp;
<p>There was a very long and impassioned debate on sff.net recently about
genre borders - how clearly can we and how clearly should we define them,
and are the current short SF markets delivering the wrong stuff and chasing
after the wrong group of readers? The best part was probably Charlie's
excellently detailed <a href="http://webnews.sff.net/read?cmd=read&group=sff.publishing.tangent-online&art=4084">post
on the market conditions for the SF mags</a>, demolishing the argument
that it is necessary to refer to content&nbsp; to explain declining circulations.
Also in there somewhere were elegant manifestos by Dave Truesdale and others
for defining the borders of SF, and by <a href="http://webnews.sff.net/read?cmd=read&group=sff.publishing.tangent-online&art=4205">Eileen
Gunn</a> and Mary Anne Mohanraj and Kelly Link among others for <i>not
</i>defining
them, at least not too strictly. And it was also instructive that the whole
thing degenerated into a flamewar: <b>people feel not only passionate,
but also threatened</b>, about the issues of borders. They feel like other
people might take the SF they like away from them.
<p>I think that's interesting. I like thinking about genre borders. I like
trying to get at meaningful differences between "science fiction" and "fantasy",
or "literary" and "mainstream", or "magical realism" and "surrealist fable",
or "erotica" and "porn". I don't expect every story to fit neatly somewhere,
but I think <b>thinking about genre can be a useful tool</b> for a writer.
It can, of course, also be <b>a trap</b>, if the borders are seen as walls.
I am leery of arguments that say "genre X is better than genre Y", or which
say "authors of sort A must only write in genre B", or "a magazine that
claims to be a Q magazine must only publish Q stories". Genres bleed together,
and interesting stuff always happens out at the borders where we our current
critical vocabularies break down.&nbsp;
<p>I consider myself still in an apprenticeship period of my writing, and
I intentionally set myself the challenge of writing in <b>as many genres</b>,
styles, and modes as I can think of. Of course, my principal writing 
<i>community</i> is the sf/f/h community -- and from all accounts, for passion, 
organization, intensity, intelligence, and friendliness, it's the best
community going. And the principal <i>traditions</i> I tend to draw from are the
pulp "weird fiction", science-fiction-as-literature-of-ideas, and
literary/surrealist/postmodernist traditions. All the more reason, in my
humble opinion, to try Westerns and haiku and gothic romance and soap
opera and saga and advertising jingles.

<i>Crimp</i> is still coming along, but slowly, slowly, slowly.&nbsp;
<p>Waiting to hear back from various markets on various stories, as usual,
but I won't bore you with them.

<p><img SRC="../journal/sep.gif" height=31 width=50></center>

<p>Aviva's vocabulary is now too big for me to chart. She occasionally
approaches sentence-like constructions, or at least strings together a
barrage of word-images together to communicate a complex thought. Like,
<b><tt>"Wia!
Daddy! Buus! Disha! Buus!"</tt></b> means "I propose that Daddy and Aviva
go visit Elisa on the bus."
<p>She has theme weeks for new vocabulary. One week it was her <b>friends'
names</b>: Wia (Aviva herself), Disha (Elisa), LuLu (Lorrine), Bim (little
Ben), Ami (Aramie), Momi (Grandma Rita), Bopi (Grandpa Simon), Papish (Pastis
the cat, also employed as a generic term for all cats), Fina (cousin Seraphina);
she'd used some of those words experimentally before, but that was the
week that it crystalized, and she delighted in being able to, suddenly,
express precisely <i>who </i>she wanted to go see.&nbsp;
<p>Then another week it was <b>verbs</b>: mohle (paint), inge (sing), hole
(get), go (go), gange (went), alle (get dressed). Some were new, some taken
out of mothballs, but that was clearly Verb Week.
