<p><b><font face="Copperplate Gothic Light">A Political Rant and Ramble
on the War</font></b>
<p>When we initially invaded Afghanistan, I was, cautiously and with mixed
feelings, in support of the war. Bush's rhetoric bothered me -- he kept
doing things like calling it a "crusade", and I couldn't figure out if
that was just stupidity or merely a priveleging of domestic politics over
foreign politics. I thought at first that we might have negotiated more
with Afghanistan; but of course no one had ever recognized the Taliban
junta, and to negotiate with them, particularly using the Shari'a as a
negotiating framework as they seemed to be proposing, might have just handed
them international legitimacy, which would be a poor message to send to
other states thinking about harboring terrorists (it's bad enough how building
nukes, as with India and Pakistan, wins you instant legitimacy and respect
on the world stage). But in terms of action and of concrete promises, we
seemed to be doing the right thing. I am generally a fan of Clinton as
a policy architect, but the typical Clintonian response to September 11th
would have been a lot of hugging and a bomb lobbed somewhere likely. This
kind of "reflexive feel-good bombing", I think, does more to generate hatred
of America than a war with some kind of comprehensible goal. Here, we had
a reasonable goal - the replacement of the Taliban, whom nobody liked (anybody
whose fundamentalist interpretation of Islam is considered a brutal offense
against humanity by <i>Iran</i> has clearly got problems) with a democratic,
pluralist state with long-term support from its neighbors and the West.
We promised not to abandon Afghanistan again; we did a good job building
a coalition that included pretty much everybody, from Russia to Iran to
the Arab States to Israel. We sent our own ground troops in -- which I
think is a critical symbolic gesture if nothing else; an enemy you can
shoot at is one you tend to respect more than one that lobs billion-dollar
hardware from the stratosphere; and in addition, having the Northern Alliance
do all the fighting would mean the Northern Alliance would be in charge
afterwards. We made it clear that Pashtun and even "moderate Taliban" would
have a place in the successor state. The dropping food thing, while in
some sense a bungled gesture -- stopping the aid agencies deprived orders
of magnitude more people of food than the drops could make up for, to name
just one problem -- was at least an important symbolic gesture that the
people of Afghanistan were not the intended targets of the war.&nbsp; In
the first stage of the war, we acted as careful and thorough multilateralists,
even while our rhetoric was occassionally unilateralist and asinine.
<p>More globally, I do think much of the violence in the world would be
fundamentally addressed by more aggressive anti-poverty and development
programs, and I do think America (at home or abroad), in contrast with,
say, Switzerland -- compare their drug policies -- prefers expensive, vindictive,
dramatic punitive measures to cheap, sensible, undramatic, preventative
ones. But it's not an entirely an either/or. The balance between prevention
and poilicing is out of whack; but that doesn't mean you don't need policing.
Bin Laden did not grow up poor. Terrorism cannot be fought exclusively
by enriching people, although enriching people, if done right, is may sometimes
be the most cost-effective way to fight it. The most effective way to fight
terrorism, as I understand it, is infiltration, which is easiest against
terrorists of your own culture (I understand that the FBI was able to thoroughly
infiltrate and decapitate the KKK in the 70s; they had enough redneck agents,
I suppose). Bludgeoning terrorism-harboring states is a very blunt instrument.
But when considering such policy issues, you have to ask, what are the
real options? Do nothing? Simply increase international anti-poverty funding?
Impose economic sanctions? Sue in the World Court? Fund proxy wars by arming
the nearest local group opposed to the people supporting the terrorists?
All of these have their own problems. Just as dictators really do pay attention
to "world opinion" and those Amnesty International letter campaigns when
deciding whom to lock up, they also pay attention to the perceived consequences
of harboring terrorists.
<p>My doubts about this war began initially with the name. It is a "War
on Terrorism". Leave aside the issue for the moment of "whose terrorism"
-- e.g., our funding for various undesireable insurgents in various places.
Let'ssay it's a war on terrorists who don't like us: fine. What exactly
is a terrorist?&nbsp;
<p>The definition I prefer is that a terrorist intentionally targets civilians,as
many as possible, in order to create terror and panic. The primary target
of the attack is civilian. This is a relatively clear definition and allows
us to distinguish terrorists from insurgents. Thus, the PKK, the Kurdish
group who I believe only attack Turkish military installations, are not
terrorists, but insurgents.&nbsp;
<p>This does lead to some interesting edge cases. A Hamas suicide bomber
who blows up a disco full of partying Israeli 19-year-olds is a terrorist;
if he attacked the same people that morning at a checkpoint when they were
in uniform, he would be merely an insurgent. The bomb at Hiroshima was
a terrorist bomb. Nonetheless, I stand by this definition. It is reasonably
logical, and it has the virtue of being able to be applied to all sides
impartially. It really has to do with the rules of war. It is very useful
for a culture (or set of cultures) to have rules of war -- taboos about
who may, and who may not be killed, when. Like the sheepdog and the wolf
in that old Warner Brothers cartoon who fight to the death, but only after
they have punched in for the day, and only until the evening whistle sounds;
then they shake hands and say "evening, sam" -- "evening, bill" -- and
go home.
<p>So it's useful to have uniforms and say "you may only shoot at the people
in these uniforms." It's a ritual, but one that constrains the scope of
war. It makes sense and it's worth fighting for.
<p>There's another often used definition of terrorist. The word is used
to mean "enemy combatants not belonging to a formal army." By this definition
the "War on Terrorism" is not an attempt to enforce the rules of war; rather,
it is an admission that "we have some enemies, but we don't really know
where they are or what they're called." This seems to me a much more dangerous
stance. (It is particularly odd to regard Taliban soldiers, draftees defending
their country, as terrorists.)
<p>Pretty quickly in this war, "terrorist" has come to simply be a nonspecific
name for "evil person worthy of destruction." Early on in the war it became
clear that terrorists were those enemies who had neither the rights of
criminals -- to a fair trial -- nor those of enemy soldiers -- to the Geneva
convention. Terrorism seems to also encompass supporting terrorism, and
what exactly does that mean? The interesting thing is that groups like
Hamas run almost all of the orphanages and hospitals in the occupied territories.
Is someone in a local mosque in America who preaches a sermon advocating
giving to Hamas a terrorist? If he is an immigrant, can he be flown to
Guantanamo Bay and detained without trial with a bag over his head?&nbsp;
<p>In the Gulf War thousands of Iraqi soldiers deserted and were greated
with hot meals and respect in the POW camps (or so it was reported). That's
a very important image; that's a great asset of the West, that we are seen
as just. If we start defending the use of torture and treating prisoners
like animals, it destroys a concrete advantage along with our soul.
<p>So the question for me is, what are we fighting for? Is it just power?&nbsp;
<p>The USA was founded by insurgents who did not belong to a recognized
formal army. Our Declaration of Independence actually enshrines the rights
of such insurgents to overthrow their government. It says in effect: the
powerless <i>will </i>and <i>should </i>fight back.
<p>The people who blew up the WTC towers were abonimable terrorists. (If
the guy who attacked the Pentagon had taken an <i>empty</i> plane, he would
have been an insurgent). Al-Qaeda should be broken up by force, and I am
glad the Taliban are defeated.
<p>But America is treading on very dangerous ground. To the extent that
we become about empire -- to the extent that the point of the war is merely
to concentrate power in us, to extinguish all opposition -- we approach
the place where our reach may exceed our grasp and the days of our empire
wane.
<p>What was the "Axis of Evil" speech supposed to be for? How is it possibly
in our national interest to undermine Khatami?
<p>The most chilling thing for me so far was 
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/east/03/13/nkorea.nuclear.bush/index.html">the 
business about nuclear weapons</a>. Apparently it was an internal Pentagon study that 
was leaked and reported, prompting the White House to say, "we haven't changed our policy
on that." The that being, basically, "we can drop nuclear weapons on anyone,
at any time, whether they have nuclear weapons or not, whether they are
a superpower or just a rinky-dink rogue state; basically anyone who messes
with us may get nuked." Reassuring, yes?
<p>How can you call various nations an Axis of Evil for attempting to obtain
nuclear weapons, while reserving the right to make a first nuclear strike
on a much smaller country with no capability of attacking you back in any
serious fashion?&nbsp;
<p>Unless the usage of "evil" and "good" here is something like "we are
good, a priori, hence we can do anything we like in the defense of good,
and anyone opposing it is by definition evil."
<p>Anyway, the nuclear thing was the last straw; I have basically lost
faith in the people running this war, and their reasons for fighting. I
hope Afghanistan becomes stable and prosperous, and I hope our sabre-rattling
towards Iraq has some useful effect without alienating the rest of the
world and embroiling us in an endless and unwinnable war. I fear, though,
that no amount of power will ever satisfy us.&nbsp;
