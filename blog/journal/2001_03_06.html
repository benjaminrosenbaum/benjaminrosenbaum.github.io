<p>Milestones and good news...
<p>I have been accepted to <a href="https://www.sff.net/clarionwest">Clarion
West</a>, so I'll be in Seattle this summer. On the same day I got the
acceptance, I achieved my target of 100 <a href="../stats.html">Clarion
points</a>. Which is almost spooky.
<p>I sold a poem, "A Gardener Betrayed By Roses", to <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange
Horizons</a>. That's my first poetry sale. It was also the first time an
editor asked me for revisions; she basically rewrote the last line for
me, and hers is better, I think.&nbsp;
<p>I got an Alas-less rejection from <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">GVG</a>!
In email! Five days after I sent the manuscript by air mail from Switzerland.
He writes of "The Death Trap of Dr. Freezo" that it's funny ("the comic
material... is great"), but that he's published "several stories in the
past few years updating superheroes" and that "there isn't enough plot
or character development in this one." Fair enough, but I think it's as
long as it can be, given what it is. I think it goes to a cluster of literary
markets that take simultaneous submissions next -- Glimmer Train, Ploughshares,
Zoetrope...
<p>And finally, "The Ant King" is finally scheduled. It will be out in
<a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a>
in July.

Finally, I have caved in in the face of massive grandparental nagging (from
my parents) and uploaded pictures of <a href="aviva/AvivaSackedOut.jpg">Aviva</a>
from my camera. The girl is <a href="aviva/AvivaSmiles020401.jpg">smiling</a>
up a <a href="aviva/MoreSmiling.jpg">storm</a> lately. One of her names
is <a href="aviva/Smilebox.jpg">Smilebox</a>. Another one is <a href="aviva/AvivaConducting.jpg">Snorgleborg
Spitfactory</a>, because she enjoys nothing more than producing copious
quantities of saliva bubbles while making burbling noises. She also, as
previously mentioned, lieks gnawing <a href="aviva/AvivaFindsHerHand.jpg">on
her hand</a>. And <a href="aviva/AvivaDancingOnTheFloor.jpg">dancing</a>
on the <a href="aviva/AvivaOnTheFloor.jpg">floor</a>. She has a greater
and greater emotional range; in the morning she is usually very <a href="aviva/AvivaStickingHerTongueOut.jpg">happy</a>,
particularly if someone is talking to her; in the evening she gets <a href="aviva/VeryTiredSweetie.jpg">tried
</a>and
very cranky, and there is only one way for her Daddy (who has no breasts)
to calm her down: cradling her prone on his forearm, constantly running
the water in the bathroom, standing in front of the mirror and singing
innumerable choruses of the dark lullaby "<a href="aviva/Simmeliberg.jpg">Simmeliberg</a>".
She really likes this. Esther thinks she looks like me in <a href="aviva/GranddaughterOfCharlieSmith.jpg">this
one.</a>
<p>The Little Weasel has had lots of visitors lately. <a href="aviva/TerriFeedsAviva2.jpg">First</a>
our friend <a href="aviva/TerriFeedsAviva.jpg">Terri</a> came from America,
bringing with her a<a href="aviva/BizarreToy.jpg"> frighteningly bizarre</a>
but very effective <a href="aviva/BizarreToy2.jpg">toy thing</a>. <a href="aviva/NickHoldsAviva.jpg">Nik</a>
also came to visit. So did <a href="aviva/RaeggiBonboAviva.jpg">R&auml;ggi</a>,
who is here playing with Aviva in the kitchen while Bonbo the dragon, having
flown in from the other room, <a href="aviva/RaeggiBonboAviva2.jpg">circles
jealously around their heads</a>. Here she is with her <a href="aviva/Cousins.jpg">cousin</a>
Seraphina. Aviva looks like a demon child in these two <a href="aviva/Cousins2.jpg">pictures</a>,
but that's just the light. Really. Her DNA are fine.&nbsp;
