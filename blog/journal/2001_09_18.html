<p>Hi. It's been a while.
<p>If you are reading this more than, say, ten years from now -- or maybe
more than fifty -- it may not immediately occur to you that I'm writing
this a week after the biggest terrorist attack in history, in which four
hijacked planes were used to kill thousands of people. America is shocked,
grieving, and preparing for war.
<p>It's been weird being in Switzerland. In America, and particularly in
New York, it seems the last week has been chaos -- not just the endlessly
recurring images on CNN and in the papers, but planes not flying, shops
closed, everyone talking about it, people frantic, people walking around
like zombies; and in New York, of course, the cordoned-off sections, the
dust plume, the grit in the air, the mutilated skyline.
<p>Here, there was plenty of news the first day, everyone was talking about
it at work, and a few co-workers asked me if everyone I knew was okay:
then that was it. Blue skies, trams running, movies showing, people thinking
of other things. It's remote; the US is a vacation spot, like Thailand
or South Africa. People are relieved no one I know was hurt, and apprehensive
about what America's reaction will be. But they don't seem to feel it as
a cataclysmic shift in the way things are; they haven't gone from living
in a peaceful, orderly world to living in a world at war. They might adjust
their travel plans, as they usually do when unpleasantness breaks out in
one or another favorite destination. But they aren't wondering: will I
be next?
<p>This has made it harder, in some ways. Friends in New York have had
to turn off the TV in order to keep sane; I found I was grateful for all
the invasive coverage of people grieving and the endless repetition of
the images of disaster. I felt like I was hammering myself with images,
until it began to feel real, like something that was actually happening.
I felt like I had to do this, because it is my country in ruins, and because
of the way everyone in America who I talked to was feeling. I wished I
could be there with them, but CNN was the next best thing. I felt that
if I stayed wrapped in the peaceful wet-cotton Swiss cocoon, it would be
a betrayal, and I would somehow also be losing something sacred and critical.
<p>The images of the towers being hit and collapsing never did manage to
penetrate. They are too unreal; as everyone has said (it's become an instant
clich&eacute;), it looks above all like Hollywood special effects. Only
one image -- of the people waving from the second tower after the first
went down -- got through. They must have known.
<p>What made me cry was that interview with the CEO of the WTC company
which lost 700 employees. Losing a son, mother, sister that way is too
hard to grasp, stays unreal; but somehow this lesser thing, the burden
this man felt to provide for 700 families got through. That and the crowds
cheering the firefighters, with posters reading "We Love You" and "Superheroes".
Acts of generosity slip through the membrane of my emotional defenses,
where acts of violence cannot.

<p>I went to the post office to mail a poem, "To Work", to <a href="http://www.thesunmagazine.org/">The
Sun</a>.&nbsp;
<p>"First class to America," I said, passing the envelope across the counter.
<p>The lady there shook her head.
<p>That was the first and only time, in that small way, that the chaos
reached my life Switzerland. Until then, it could have been a trick played
by my friends and CNN.

<p>So let's see... I sent "A Siege of Cranes" to <a href="http://www.blackgate.com">Black
Gate</a> first after all, skipping <i>Realms of Fantasy</i>. I did this
after lurking on the <i>Black Gate</i> newsgroup on sff.net for a while
and coming to the conclusion that they were doing really well -- 60% sellthrough
at Borders, apparently, which is supposedly really good for a magazine.
The story is really much more their style than RoF's -- I did write it
for them, after all. And people on the <a href="http://www.speculations.com/rumormill">Rumor
Mill</a> are forever bitching about RoF's response times. And <i>Black
Gate</i> takes email subs.
<p>My story cycle "Other Cities" -- composed of 12 unrelated short-shorts,
all sketches of cities -- sold finally to <a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange
Horizons</a>. They'll run one a month for the next year. The first one,
<a href="http://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2001/20010917/bellur.shtml">"Bellur"</a>,
is up already.
<p>The critique group of my Clarion West classmates is off to a good start:
I got lots of excellent feedback on "The City of Peace". I tried to go
back and revise that story, but it was slow going; at the moment its themes
are too close to the events tearing at our hearts.
<p>I think I may devote some more time to "Crimp" soon -- Lord knows I've
been avoiding it long enough, trying the infinite patience of my collaborator
Ramin, who luckily is the kindest and most forebearing of men. I'm intimidated
at getting more into it, because it's a novel. In a way I feel I should
dive into a novel and work on only it until it's done; but on the other
hand, there's no guarantee it'll ever be done, and I have so many stories
that are almost there...

<p>I've been awfully remiss at uploading pictures of Aviva, I know.
<p>Our friend Jeanne Kramer took a beautiful series of photos in April,
which are <a href="http://www.picturetrail.com/kramersmyth/409604">here.</a>
<p>More of Aviva in Boston, back in April:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="aviva/AtPas01.jpg">1&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;

<br>&nbsp;
<p>Here's what I wrote to a friend about life with Aviva:
<blockquote><tt>aviva is pulling herself up on things and standing up,
waving her arms around and declaiming proudly, "bababababaBA!" She is tolerant
of her 5-o'clock shadowed daddy hunched in his bathrobe on the couch, glued
to CNN. She crawls over to him and thumps her forehead against his feet
until he notices.</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Aviva is just at the border of walking -- she has this wooden thing
she used to lie under, the kind that dangles toys over a baby's head; now
she pulls herself up on it and pushes it around the room, sort of taking
unsteady steps and collapsing occasionally. She's very good at falling;
I watch her execute these amazing controlled falls, forcing myself not
to just catch her immediately.&nbsp;
<p>She likes being upside down a lot, and she likes it when other people
are upside down, too, particularly when they suddenly appear, upside down.
<p>She's a well of joy that we drink from every day.
