<p>I guess I was rather cryptic and depressive about "Droplet" in my last
entry. Since then a bunch of people have read it -- Esther, Martin and
<a href="https://members.aol.com/heytrey/">Trey</a>
of RMCrit, Jamey when he visited, and Rebecca while we were at my Brown
reunion. Noone else had the reaction I did -- that the ending was too violent.
I guess I just get the heebie-jeebies when I write a rape scene...Yuk.
<p>Esther hated it, but not because of the violence -- she thought it was
just too complex and alien, and she couldn't sympathize with any of the
characters. She's not a science fiction reader, though, so when she hates
things for having intricate world-building and truly alien aliens, I think
that's a <i>good</i> sign. Everybody else seems to like it. I sent it to
Mary Anne Mohanaraj for her erotic anthology "Bodies of Water". Its chances
are not great -- she wrote on the <a href="https://www.speculations.com/rumormill">Rumor
Mill </a>that she's swamped with sf/f submissions for the anthology and
has only a couple of slots for sf/f. But what the hell.
<p>If it bounces there, I will have to tone the sex down some and submit
it to <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">GVG</a>. I won't have time while
I'm at <a href="https://www.sff.net/clarionwest">Clarion West</a>, so unless
I want to preemptively bowlderize it this week, it won't go out again until
August.
<p>I was waiting for "Baby Love" from <a href="https://www.asimovs.com">Asimov's</a>
in vain! They don't track manuscripts: if you don't hear in 3 months, you're
supposed to assume it was lost in the mail and resubmit. Argh!! Four months
wasted!! From now on I send a self-addressed "We received your manuscript"
postcard along! Anyway, I'm sick of waiting for them, so I sent it to <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">GVG</a>.
If he bounces t, it'll go to Analog, Asimov's again, or SCIFI.COM next...
<p>I finally finished my revision of "A Siege of Cranes". I cut over a
thousand words and managed, I think, to deal with most of the problems
people had with it. I'm pleased. It goes out to GVG when I hear about "Baby
Love".
<p>I got a request for revision on "Other Cities" from <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange
Horizons</a> -- they wanted me to expand it, of all things! I now have
and I'll be sending the expanded version to them again shortly. This is
the second time I've submitted to <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com">Strange
Horizons</a> and the second time I got a request for revision -- all their
editors seem to be creative, opinionated, fun to work with, and generous
with authorial feedback.&nbsp;

In a week I'll be at Clarion West. I'm trying to wrap everything up here,
pack and get ready. I'm so excited! I think this will be sooooo much fun....

<p>Aviva is a very friendly and energetic little girl. Her latest favorite
thing to do is flying, in which I pick her up as if she were an airplane
and swing her forward. She has the most beatific expression as she's soaring
through the air.
