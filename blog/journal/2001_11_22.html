<p>Happy Thanksgiving!
<p>Lots of writing news, hmm, let's see. Many people I like are selling
their stories, which makes me happy. My <a href="https://www.sff.net/clarionwest">Clarion
West</a> classmates <a href="https://www.goodhair.com/z/images/2_kiini_pic.jpg">Kiini</a>
and Ibi sold stories to <u>Dark Matter 2</u>, the sequel to the groundbreaking
and well-received <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0446677248/benjaminrosenbau/">Dark
Matter </a>anthology of speculative fiction by writers of African descent.
Kiini was in the first one, too, and man, was I jealous of her getting
anthologized alongside <a href="https://www.pcc.com/~jay/delany/">Samuel
R. Delany, Jr.</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/search-handle-form/103-5918012-2947055">Octavia
Butler</a>, two of my favorite writers (not to mention <a href="https://www.sff.net/people/nalo/">Nalo
Hopkinson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_E_B_Du_Bois">W.E.B.
DuBois</a>!). Both those stories were written at our Clarion. Michael also
sold a story written at CW2k1, to the <a href="https://www.uow.edu.au/~rhood/agogpress/">Agog!</a>
anthology. I loved all three stories, and you should buy those anthologies
when they come out.
<p>So basically our Clarion is kicking ass already.&nbsp; Woo hoo!
<p>Also, the talented and wonderfully-named <a href="https://www.sff.net/people/hoosier.red/webrats.html">Web
Rat</a> <a href="https://www.geocities.com/hilarymoonmurphy/">Hilary Moon
Murphy</a> sold her story "The Run of the Fiery Horse" (which we critiqued
in RMCrit, so she owes us a beer) to <u>Realms of Fantasy</u>. I believe
that's her first pro sale. Hopefully this will motivate her to start her
journal again, so I can read about <a href="https://www.geocities.com/hilarymoonmurphy/2000-1230.html">Gapati-Baba</a>.
And I notice that <a href="https://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/">Charlie
Finlay</a> sold yet another damn story to <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a>
-- his fifth this year or something. Jeez, ease up, guy, leave some room
for the rest of us, all right? But I must forgive him this, because it
is titled "A Democracy of Trolls" and he has promised me that he will base
upon it a Broadway musical, <a href="https://www.trollsthemusical.com">"Trolls!"</a>
<p>(You know, this just occurred to me: I love that I know all these writers
now. It's like a fringe benefit of writing, one I hadn't ever really thought
about. Writers are clever and fun to talk to. When I read people's work
that I like I write them and say, " hey! I like your stuff!" and they write
back and say "Thanks!" and occasionally also "Hey! I like your stuff too!"
and this is very neat. Programmers, for instance, don't do this. Well probably
serious <a href="https://www.wall.org/~larry/">Larry-Wall</a>-level Open
Source geeks do, but not programmers like me.)
<p>Anyway, I also have writing news about me:
<br>&nbsp;
<table COLS=1 WIDTH="90%" >
<tr>
<td>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.scifi.com/scifiction">Ellen</a> rejected "Baby Love":
"a little too sweet, with no edges." Quick response, which I'm grateful
for. I think "Baby Love" is retiring for a while with "Corporate Anthropology",
etc., to the pile of short stories to revise thoroughly some day in the
future when I'm blocked about new stuff.</li>

<li>
I got an acceptance for "The Orange" from <a href="https://www.webdelsol.com/Quarterly_West/">Quarterly
West</a>. Cool! My first publication in a print lit mag.</li>

<li>
I think me and Jed Hartman are finally done with the revisions for "<a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/Archive.alt.pl?Dept=f&Stng=other+cities+%23&Sort=chron">Other
Cities</a>" (yes, it's been running for three months, but we were still
revising it. Jed is great -- he and I can have a very serious cycle of
four or five emails about a single semicolon. Sometimes the process has
been frustrating, but I really love that someone else cares that much about
my semicolons.)</li>

<li>
The third piece in the "Other Cities", <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2001/20011119/ahavah.shtml">"Ahavah"</a>,
is up.</li>

<li>
<a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2001/20010416/gardener_betrayed.shtml">"A
Gardener Betrayed By Roses"</a> was selected for the "Best of Strange Horizons

And now a Thanksgiving present for my long-suffering parents and all Aviva's
other fans: pictures!
<p>First the old ones: I finally got the camera connection working, so
I was able to finally download all the pictures from the camera.&nbsp;
<p>This is Aviva at four months old:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="aviva/FourMonthsOld03.jpg">3</a>

<p>About that time Ethan came to visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="aviva/WithEthan01.jpg">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="aviva/WithEthan06.jpg">6</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p>And we all went away over easter vacation with&nbsp;
<br>Esther's gang the Come Back Gl&ouml;bb:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="aviva/Easter01.jpg">1</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>Then Jamey came to visit:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<a href="aviva/SingingWithJamey.jpg">1</a>
<p>Here is Aviva with Amire from next door:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>We're not doing anything for Thanksgiving.
<p>Except giving thanks.&nbsp;
<p>Man, do we have a lot to be thankful for. Especially for Aviva. What
a different world it was last Thanksgiving, without her in it!&nbsp; Thanks,
God, in all your alien Otherness, for this gift.
