<p>It is hot here in Switzerland. Very, very hot. For Switzerland anyway.
This is not a country with a lot of air conditioners.
<p><a href="https://www.sff.net/people/hmm/">Hilary Moon Murphy</a>, one
of my inspirations to start web-journalling, has 
<a href="https://www.sff.net/people/hmm/2002-0619.htp">retired
her journal</a>. Goodbye Hilary! Goodbye Ganpati-Baba! Alas! Well, it's
to spend more time writing fiction though. So that's all right. I guess.
<p>One of the problems of making this journal kinda quarterly is that people
I like achieve mountains of things and it takes too long to congratulate
them all. <a href="https://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/">Charlie</a>'s
"Political Officer" was a gripping and intriguing read; Hilary broke spendidly
into print; my fellow Clarion Westies have been exploding into print and
breaking into pro markets right and left; they are also proving fertile
and fecund in other regards. My friend <a href="https://www.ethanham.com">Ethan</a>
has become a kick-ass sculptor. And so on. I'm forgetting much. Congratulations
to everyone!

<p><a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2002/20020415/maxis.shtml">Maxis,</a>
<a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2002/20020520/jouiselle.shtml">Jouiselle-aux-Chantes,</a>
and <a href="https://www.strangehorizons.com/index.pl?Contents=/2002/20020617/penelar.shtml">Penelar</a>
of the "Other Cities" are up. Penelar is another of my favorites. I notice
I'm getting more critical of them now, though. Penelar is very wordy. J-aux-C
is a bit vague at the end. Maxis is just a gag.&nbsp;
<p>They've been getting nice reviews, though, at the marvelous short fiction
reviewing ezine, <a href="https://www.tangentonline.com">Tangent Online</a>.(You
can see a list of reviews on my <a href="../biblio.html">bibilography</a>
page). The reviewers are generally right, I think. Including about <a href="https://www.tangentonline.com/reviews/magazine.php3?review=592">changing
a word</a> in the last line of <u>Maxis</u>. Jed Hartman of Strange Horizons
suggested the same change. I'm stubborn sometimes though.
<p>"Droplet" is out in newsstands in the USA now, in the July 2002 issue
of <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a>. Nice, well-thought-out
reviews of it from <a href="https://www.tangentonline.com/reviews/magazine.php3?review=624">Tangent</a>
and at <a href="https://www.bluejack.com/sff/zin/fsf/0207.html#04">Bluejack</a>'s
site. I appreciate both reviews a lot. I think my reading of the story
is closer to Bluejack's -- for me the real plot of the story is the love
story, and the adventure story is background, as opposed to the other way
around.&nbsp;
<p>Check out Bluejack's <a href="https://www.bluejack.com/sff/au/rosenbaum.html">author
bio</a> of me too. I am tickled.
<p>My short story production has slowed down considerably: I am trying
to focus on <i>Crimp. </i>It's a whole 'nother ball game writing a novel.
A marathon as opposed to a sprint. It's hard for me to maintain the momentum.
I've written a couple more chapters since I last posted. I think they're
pretty good. But it's much harder to keep the whole thing in mind and much
easier to be beset by doubts. I fret about how <i>long</i> it'll be before
a first draft is done and we can get any kind of useful feedback.&nbsp;
<p>One thing that bugs me is that I can't come up with a good, snappy one-sentence
summary of <i>Crimp</i>. It's not a story that follows one sympathetic
protagonist through adventurous try-fail sequences attempting to resolve
some problem. Rather, it's got a large and disparate cast of mortals and
immortals, few of whom are entirely sympathetic -- and the sympathetic
ones are not the most successful, by and large -- and six of whom are arguably
the protagonist of the piece. Their conflicts are many-layered, things
are not always what they seem, motives and alliances shift over the course
of the action... how the hell do you write a sentence for that?&nbsp;
<p>OK, here's <a href="./crimp-sentence.html">an
attempt </a>(if you hate spoilers and plan to read Crimp, don't click).
That one leaves the sympathetic normal characters out of it entirely; probably
a good call...
<p>'Kay, I'll stop grumbling now.

<p>My uncle Drew, who was very sick last time I posted, seems to be doing
better. Whew.&nbsp;

<p>These are all a few months old; more recent ones next time.
<p>Despite the fact that we're approaching the much-dreaded Terrible Twos,
Aviva is actually much calmer about hearing "No" now. She has a lot more
words to negotiate with, and she has developed more patience. She considers
"No" to be merely my initial negotiating position. She doesn't like it,
but she doesn't panic about it.
<p>She's beginning to grasp the concept of possession and get somewhat
annoyed when other kids take things away from her. Sometimes even quite
upset; but not usually, unless it's something really personal like someone
else crawling into her baby carriage. Recently we were at the drop-in playgroup
down the street and this much bigger boy came up and snatched her ball
away. She kind of blinked at him like, okay, is this a new game? I handed
her another toy, a soccer-ball-sized foam rubber cube. The big boy came
back to snatch that away too. Aviva didn't get mad; she just kind of hunkered
down, stuck her butt out in back for balance, and hung on with all her
strength. And stared him calmly right in the eye. He couldn't get it away
from
her, and after trying for a while he ran off. She looked kind of smug.
So did I.
