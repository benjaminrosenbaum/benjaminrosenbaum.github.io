<p>Well, gentlepeoples, welcome to the new millennium (for Pascal programmers,
anyway; for C programmers the new millennium started last year...).
<p>Gee, I suppose I should say something about the birth. It was scarier,
more intense, more horrific, and <b>longer </b>than I expected (we were
basically awake doing nothing else for 48 hours -- with a few hours of
sleep in the middle of that). But it was also, in a way, simpler and happier
than I expected; I felt like Esther and I were a team, and I generally
felt like I knew what to do next to make her feel better. It was a wonderful
adventure, the way having your legs bitten off by a shark and having to
swim 500 miles to an unknown island carrying your amputated legs, and then
having them sown back on, is a wonderful adventure. Which is to say...
in retrospect. It was Esther, of course, who had to swim carrying her legs;
I was in the motorboat next to her shouting encouragement through a megaphone.
And then, after reaching the shore and re-attaching her legs, we found
that we had landed in a wonderful new country, a country we had always
dreamed about, and that waiting there for us was an alien stranger who
was the most perfect person in the world, and who we loved with a huge
love that held up the sky.
<p>The alien stranger, Aviva, is our new roommate, and I must say I have
never had a more messy or demanding roommate, nor one with a more wonderful
smile.
<p>Well, I will not assault you with any more pictures of the Aviva <a href="LittleMonkey.jpg">The
Little Monkey</a>, unless you really want to see them.
<p>So... after two weeks of blissful and sleep-deprived exclusive concentration
on diaper changing and the like, I am turning my attention back to writing.
I <i>think</i> I sent an appeal for critiquers for <u>Other Cities</u>
to the RMCrit folk -- maybe the email never got sent? If I did send it,
it was met with a resounding silence. Perhaps because of the holidays,
or perhaps I scared everyone off by mentioning that it had no plot or characters?
Anyway, I've been reading it aloud to some of our many visitors (my parents
were here, and my sister and her boyfriend, and practically everyone we
know in Switzerland paraded by for the little princess's review), and got
some reactions. It's only a 1200-word bit of whimsy, anyway... how much
critiquing does it need? So I am going to send it off to GVG today. I don't
think he'll take it, really -- it's a little too plotless and literary
for <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a> -- but I'd like a fast
"alas" (that's how GVG always phrases a rejection) before I send it off
to slower markets like <a href="https://www.sfsite.com/interzone/">Interzone</a>
or <u><a href="https://www.kenyonreview.org">The Kenyon Review</a></u> or
whatever; <i>some</i> kind of reaction is preferable to interminable waiting.
<p>I am slowly being driven mad, at present, by waiting for responses to
the stories I have out now. I sent <u>The Death Trap of Dr. Freezo</u>
to <u><a href="https://www.newyorker.com">The New Yorker</a></u> in mid-September
and I haven't heard anything yet. What drives me crazy is not just the
over-three-month wait; it's the fact that the story is good -- I think
it's salable in its current incarnation -- and that there is an astronomically
small chance of <u>The New Yorker</u> actually buying it... I mean, who
am I kidding, right?&nbsp; I am also waiting for <u>The Orange</u> (sent
to <a href="https://www.harpers.org">Harper's</a> in October) and <u>The
White City</u> (sent to <a href="https://www.blackgate.com">Black Gate</a>
in early November). I've been spoiled by GVG's two-week turnaround and
personal rejection letters. I think <u>The White City</u> might have a
chance -- though again, it's probably too literary -- but the other two
are really potshots.&nbsp;
<br>Day after day, my mailbox remains chillingly empty, and I know that
I'm only getting form letters out of these people anyway!
<p>Of course, as I always tell myself when looking in that cold, empty
mailbox, if they're seriously <i>considering</i> it, I don't mind waiting.
<p>But more likely the manuscripts are sitting in a stack somewhere.
<p>Still, the cure for this is <i>writing</i>: it's only because I haven't
been writing new stuff that I've been so obsessed with the empty mailbox!&nbsp;
