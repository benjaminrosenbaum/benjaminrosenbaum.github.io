<p>Hi there, long time no see.&nbsp; There's some news after the rambling
if you want to <a href="#news">skip down</a>.
<p>Let's see, what have I been up to? I wrote a poem, "Stuck in Traffic
on Highway 101: A Meditation on the Virtual" (which belongs with "The Ant
King" in some kind of&nbsp; "Nostalgic Silicon Valley Parodies" series),
finished up a poem called "To work" that I've been working on forever (it's
a Whitmanesque series of images and always seemed unfinished, so I added
a philosophical little rhyming coda... I don't know if it's an improvement
or not, but I'm sick of it lying around), and sent them off together with
"Susie" (in its original incarnation as a poem) to a fun little lit mag
called <i>Amelia</i>. And I wrote a couple of beginnings to short stories.
All that, really, as a way of procrastinating on revising "A Siege of Cranes".
<p>I got a lot of good critiques back. Maybe too many. I don't know, sometime
I want to write something and have everyone say, "Wow, this is the best
story in the history of Western Literature! Don't change ANYTHING!" This
has not happened yet.&nbsp; I got ten critiques of this story, if you count
showing it to Esther as a first reader. Some people loved it. Some people
hated it. Ten critiques was a little overwhelming. I sometimes feel like
I need to change everything anyone didn't like. (I know, I <a href="2001_01_19.html">just
went on</a> about following your vision even against the majority vote
of the critiques, but I'm mercurial like that.)&nbsp;
<p>The top five things people hated about "A Siege of Cranes" were:
<ul>
<li>
Pacing, especially the beginning being slow and pompous (and somewhat irrelevant)</li>

<li>
The d&eacute;nouement not being foreshadowed or set up in the slightest</li>

<li>
The hero's dialect being inconsistent (especially since the plot calls
attention to it)</li>

<li>
The villain's motivations being unclear</li>

<li>
The voice of the story being too emotionally distant from the hero</li>
</ul>
Well, I took a crack at it on Friday and wrote a new beginning which foreshadows
at least some of the ending a little better. I have an idea for explaining
the villain's motivations. I tried to bring the tone a little closer to
the emotions of the hero, but I may end up being somewhat stubborn here:
I like the tone being somewhat distant -- I think it works for Sword and
Sorcery, I think it bestows some subtlety and grandeur. (However, at the
same time I'm somewhat suspicious of myself; I think a flaw in my writing
in general is a lack of convincing emotion. I'm more comfortable with things
being droll and dry and removed, or with deep emotion being implied in
an understated way, off screen as it were. So I'll struggle with it some
more in "A Siege of Cranes" and try to find a balance.)
<p>The big problem I have -- oddly, since it doesn't seem like it would
be that big a problem -- is with Marish's dialect. I actually think the
way I hear Marish -- the way he talks in my head -- <i>is</i> consistent;
it's both sort of folksy and archaic; it's not like any dialect I've heard,
it's just the way they spoke in Ilmak Dale. I think I could do it in a
spoken monologue and people would get it. However, I despair of communicating
it on the printed page. People pretty unanimously had a problem with it,
and unlike the emotional distance or the alienation at the end of "Baby
Love", this is <i>not</i> something where I feel like I should stick to
my guns out of artistic integrity. In "Baby Love", I think I produced the
effect I wanted in the reader -- people sympathized with Ted, but were
disturbed. People just didn't always <i>like </i>that, but that's okay.
But here, I am not producing the effect I want at all. It's just not coming
across. It's a clear case of "murder your darlings".&nbsp;
<p>However, I have no clue how to make Marish's dialect recognizable and
consistent and not totally cheesy, except to make it standard English,
and that gives me an annoying plot problem. I suppose I could invent something
other than Marish's dialect for the djinn to buy, but somehow I'm totally
uninspired to do so. Blah. After I hit this problem, I stopped revising
and brooded and played <a href="https://www.gamesdomain.com/gdreview/zones/reviews/pc/sep99/testt.html">Civilization</a>
all weekend (which, after <a href="https://www.digitaladdiction.com">Sanctum</a>
of course, is my favorite computer game). When I used to be in the game
industry I could play computer games all night and call it research. Now
I can call it... ah... working out creative tension. Yeah. And lying fallow.
That's it.
<p>[I also read two good books, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0394758250/benjaminrosenbau/107-3537575-1936502">The
Lady in The Lake</a> by Raymond Chandler (not as good as Farewell, My Lovely,
but still, the man is a master) and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0743400569/benjaminrosenbau/107-3537575-1936502">Fake
Liar Cheat</a> by Tod Goldberg -- a first novel, and an excellent one.
The voice is great, the pace is unrelenting, and it's very funny. I was
reading it this morning and I could hardly manage to stop and go to work.
The ending was a little bit of a letdown, though. Oh, and I saw <u>Mystery
Men</u> on DVD: corny but funny and sometimes delightful.]
<p>Some of this procrastination (and I was also pretty cranky when not
doping myself with fiction and electronic entertainment) may also have
been nervous will-I-get-in-to-Clarion tension, which brings me chronologically
to Monday morning's email...

<p>Yep, I got into <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~clarion/">Clarion East</a>.
I will be spending six weeks this summer (most of them away from Aviva,
which sounds like sheer hell at the moment
<b><tt><font size=+1>;-&lt;</font></tt></b>
) being pounded and fired like a Ploughshare of Longing beaten into a Sword
of Truth. Or something. Either in Michigan or in Seattle, as I am still
waiting for a response from <u><a href="https://www.sff.net/clarionwest/">Clarion
West</a></u>. Clarion West is actually my preference, as it would be easier
timing-wise for Esther and Aviva to visit in the middle of my stay, I have
friends in Seattle, and Octavia Butler is teaching and I think her work
is fascinating.
<p>This clears up my tension depression, and I am pretty excited -- when
I think about the six weeks themselves, other than the missing Aviva and
Esther part, I can't help but smile and bounce up and down a little. At
the same time, I didn't actually run around the house hyperventilating
the way I did when I sold "The Ant King". Partly this is because this means
the hard work has just begun -- I'm a little daunted by Clarion, now that
it's real. If I thought ten email critiques, mostly positive, of&nbsp;
"A Siege of Cranes" over the course of a couple of weeks was hard to take,
how am I gonna take the intensity of speculative fiction boot camp? Yikes.
<p>And the other thing is that, somehow, I've just been assuming I'm going.
I know that sounds a little cocky. But I've spent so much time and energy
dreaming about and preparing for Clarion that it's just gradually grown
from being a wild idea to being a certainty in my head. I just declared
I'm going and the universe has to hustle along to get in line with that.
I know that's odd, but that's what it feels like. I saw it in my email
and my heart jumped, but at the same time I thought: "Ah, yes. Of course."
<p><a href="https://members.home.net/ksumnersmith/feb2301.html">Karina</a>
got in too! The one consolation for not getting into Clarion West would
be getting to go with a fellow Web Rat. (Are any other Rats applying this
year?) Congrats Karina!
<p>Other good news from this morning's email: <a href="https://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/smp.html">Sock
Monkey</a> <a href="https://home.earthlink.net/~ccfinlay/">Charles Coleman
Finlay</a> reports that he and I are listed together as upcoming new authors
in the "Coming Attractions" blurb of this months' <a href="https://www.fsfmag.com">F&amp;SF</a>.
What fun!
<p>And, a rejection of "Corporate Anthropology" from Paul Fraser of <a href="https://www.spectrumsf.co.uk">Spectrum
SF</a>, who writes:

<p>Ouch. But you know, he's right. My excellent critiquers from RMCrit
will perhaps be annoyed to learn that, frustrated with tinkering with it
and without the oomph to make the big changes needed, I just sent off the
old version. I guess I won't send it again until I actually go through
with that revision I keep talking about.&nbsp;
<p>Still, I like getting rejections. They mean closure. Though an acceptance
is better, mail is mail. I'm like a six-year-old acting up; positive attention
is preferable, but I'll take what I can get.

<p>The Aviva report! I don't have any actual new pictures, but here's an
<a href="BlurryEstherAndAviva.jpg">unintentionally
arty</a> one you haven't seen, and here she is with Esther's <a href="RitaSimonAndAviva.jpg">folks</a>,
I don't think you've seen that one either.
<p>Aviva is getting stronger, more in touch with her environment, and more
purposeful. She has crossed the line from pretty clearly just flailing
her arms in response to stimuli to a state where it's a judgment call if
she's flailing or reaching. She reacts differently to different sounds
(she grins when you say "OOooo!") and sometimes says things back (like
"oo!" and "oigle!"). She has more complex expressions, like pride, mischievous
delight, rage and betrayal. That's what they look like anyway. Betrayal
comes up when you turn her over when she was PERFECTLY COMFORTABLE THE
WAY SHE WAS, THANK YOU!
<p>Aviva is not really into this whole being on her stomach thing. If you
put her on her stomach she immediately does a push-up, picking her head
and as much of her chest off the floor as she can manage. She's actually
pretty pleased with herself for about three seconds of this, at which point
she stops finding it amusing and starts bobbing downwards unsteadily, rocking
back and forth, and getting really mad. We do it anyway sometimes because,
you know, won't she end up looking all funny if she's never on her stomach?
But we have a pretty low tolerance for her frustration.
